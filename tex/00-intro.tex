In this assignment you will write code for a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model using RNNs. The NMT system is more complicated than the neural networks we have previously constructed within this class and takes about \textbf{4 hours to train on a GPU}. Thus, we strongly recommend you get started early with this assignment. Finally, the notation and implementation of the NMT system is a bit tricky, so if you ever get stuck along the way, please post a question in the Slack workspace or contact your Course Facilitator
