So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we're not at the best time, and you have to put the systems on their site.
And there are perhaps not more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, of having to take a very important decision about the future of our health care or the one being loved to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of us making medical decisions, and in fact for making financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that you have to take out of a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I received the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, attack the heart of the brain.
So one is thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you may have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, it's even likely you can know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you should ask for the most doctors don't want to talk and companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or put a surgery in any medical procedure before you can help a person.
And it has to think about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work.
And it's not the doctor, and if it's women's guilt -- it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well the <unk> mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number needs to treat the most widely <unk> which you think is it?
How many people have to take it before you help a person?
300.
This is according to the research of the researchers, <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I would explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack or a brain <unk> or another event.
Now maybe you think, "Well, one chance in 300 feet down my <unk>
Why no, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everybody else.
But then you have to ask for a more, and it is, <unk> from the <unk> effects.
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of the patients.
And those include things -- <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, "The five percent is not very likely to go to me, but take the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how to do this with the time, so you don't have to make the supply chain on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of 300 people have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get rid of the drug that will help you the drug.
I don't say they should or not take the <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to initiate the conversation about if you want to take risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary number one is quite typical.
For the surgery that is done in the older men from 50, <unk> from prostate cancer, the number necessary to treat is <unk>
So it's 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, produce 50 percent of the patients.
Those include the bandwidth or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you are lucky and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects only <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think of time before the questions that you can argue that we would take the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice too many times, they want a shorter life of pain, or a long life that could have much pain to the end?
These are the things they speak and think about now, with his family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that they get a lot of systems.
There's a evolutionary reason for this.
Let's face the face with a predator -- it's not necessary for the <unk> or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending metabolism on those things, it doesn't react to be the lunch of the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the logical thought of rational thinking like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown you.
So we have to be able to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail in time.
The idea is to think about the future how these <unk> could be able to put the systems in the place that will help minimize harm, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
I went to the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor set up a combination of combination along the door, with a key door to the front door in the same, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of messages from mail that I haven't seen.
So I am not very sorry, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the middle, you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be, never <unk> a whole silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French language language came over the '80s and over the time of time, mixed with local signs and developed the language that we now know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and they taught me to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world is like I lived in a country where I lived in a country where they were following their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound sound.
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my <unk> and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people say.
So I've learned for example.
"Don't <unk>
Don't do a lot of noise to eat the bag of <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating sure not <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is all called <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm a <unk> <unk> of the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is for coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk>
It was going to go around and go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see the <unk> don't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the subtle <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do it with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I have just four lines on the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for a artistic apartment there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and while I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has entered my territory of art.
It's going to be <unk>
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my practice.
And everything that had taught me how much of the sound, I decided to leave and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was stuck with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> the social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that I could be able to get it to me and my art work, or I could make it <unk>
I chose to make me <unk>
There's a massive culture around the language of speech.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if you didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me just and become my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant in the current society.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for your voices, I am able to keep a temporary form of value -- like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I will not continue to do this practice, I feel that I could make it in the <unk> and you don't have any kind of social value.
So with the sound like my new artistic half the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and express fully on the paper.
And the same thing can be said about a concept in <unk>
The two are very space and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much as the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor metaphor for you to understand how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> is divided into a lot of different <unk>
If you measure a different class for each finger while you touch the piano, as the facial expression, the motion of the body, the speed, the shape of your hand and so while the piano, the English is a linear language, such as if you put it up just one against the time.
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in a place to express a very clear concept or idea in <unk>
If only one key would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens to the music in the way to tone <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the <unk> sign on that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk>
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and take it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
So for example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and you see it.
This is all the day."
If you put it up, and we <unk> the visually speed, it looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said of <unk> <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express change in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> a again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific pace of <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically would automatically go into <unk> same time."
Look at <unk> right hand -- <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through my head and my chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can do it with me?
All of the hands in high.
Now we're going to do it as much in your head like your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yes, very good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all of the cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please do it again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job all.
Notice how the three signs are very similar. They all occur in your head and the chest. But they get very different meanings in your head.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and successful as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> does not have a social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> not you have to hear music.
The <unk> is a rich treasure.
I'd like to give you to open his ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience from our visual language.
And you never know, they can fall into love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a kid, my parents told me, "Can you get <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
The freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence, or a bubble of ignorance I should say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the awful truth.
When I get older, I learned that the adults also <unk> and that they are not very good at clean up the others.
Time time, I'm now adult and teach citizen and invention in the U.S. Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk on the beach with lots of waste.
So as a good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but now more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of this.
And in the last decades, we have been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very <unk> to use those huge boats of it.
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> <unk> work so that kids are very <unk> they can also participate.
And I will tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools are really cool and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce the size we found in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to engage them in something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the kids would get a lot with robots.
And then we created quickly what we call "a <unk>
We are so quick in the creation of prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turned out light and cameras and <unk> and <unk> in a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture of the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board is processing this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that somebody else would get it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I'm trying to investigate my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very good children.
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and you get rid of this thing.
A kid, maybe less than 10 years ago, holding a oil spill -- just using the hands, in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water <unk> the water where they live.
You can see that the water is brown and the mud and oil is also brown color and when it all <unk> it is very difficult to see what in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can spread through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help identify what in the water.
<unk> this prototype with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help the remote shape to other children.
I'm trying to investigate a problem to <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further away, maybe to tackle a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and half French and perhaps remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that we had a variety of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> were removed several cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives you the nuclear power plant in addition, a nuclear power plant close to water.
And today, according to the reports for the average of 300 tons -- it's still taken from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has the traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the <unk> radiation everywhere.
But if you look on the map, it seems to be that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and the majority of the time, has pretty sure, is blue.
Well, it's actually a little more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and research with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course they didn't get the <unk> the parents don't get it.
But every night we got to the center of <unk> here you see the use.
It might seem like they didn't take the serious job, but they did because they have to live with the <unk> your whole life.
Together with them we discussed the <unk> data, that day and talk about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we create a <unk> map of the region around the region of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> again, to represent data in real time from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the radioactive powder is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> and <unk> system in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized a civil expedition -- the closest to the nuclear power to the date.
We get closer to 1.5 miles of nuclear power, and with the <unk> force of the area we went to the area of the floor of the sea floor with a string of sediment as we invented and we built it.
So here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a problem -- to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been more and more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit small so much, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and convert it into the largest space dedicated to social impact and environmental impact.
It's at the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry -- a little bit of biology, and basically, you can build almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become true with adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the age of old age transforming their standard wheels of standard wheels in new <unk> vehicles.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are <unk>
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So as a scientists, including <unk> we have to prepare the next generation for the environment and the people, and so that I can really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically <unk>
One is made out of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a single thread of silk.
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
A place on the environment, the other thing we thought of.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Miguel angel said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> saw a figure that will fight for being free.
The <unk> was a single tool of Miguel now.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information that was required by every cell to work and work for <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
<unk> lines have dictated a world of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think about their objects as <unk> of different parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial balls are thin with <unk>
The balls on the back are smaller with little <unk>
You acts mainly as the other part mainly as a barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there is no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that gradually vary their functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here's a divided screen that represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and architect to work now between the <unk> and the gene, between the <unk> and the organism, between the assembly and the organism, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere and the right hemisphere -- and synthetic is shown in the two screens after me.
My work, in its simplest level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving from the assembly and near growth.
You probably ask, why now?
Why wasn't it possible for this 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment where we have four disciplines that offer me designers to the tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I think.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We designed objects, products, structures and tools through a large scale, like this robotic arm with a 24 meters in diameter with a force that some day not very far very far out to print <unk> buildings and graphs made of genetically strong <unk>
So here we have <unk> the <unk> a archetype of the ancient Arab architecture and has created a screen where every single component is the only size of light to model the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion <unk> of Paris with <unk> <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with 3D printing 3D printing -- we printed this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> and I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combined <unk> materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner too.
That designers have access to this high resolution <unk> and the <unk> instruments allows you to design products that are <unk> not just the way our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissue.
We also designed a acoustic chair a chair to the very comfortable <unk> and also it absorbs sound.
Professor <unk> my collaborator went back to the nature of <unk> and designing this pattern of <unk> <unk> becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
His surface, as in nature, they vary their functionality not by addition to the addition of other material or another <unk> but <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
But it's nature <unk>
There is no parts in nature?
I was not raised in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories about the Bible <unk> and one of them became a lot of what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of the <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that very first <unk> tree there would be no difference between trunk, branches, leaves and <unk>
All the tree was a flies.
Instead, the land made trees to grow up trees with branches, <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often ask, "What would the design be if the objects was made out of one box.
It would take a better state of the <unk>
So we were looking for the material to <unk> the kind of material of the tree with fruit and we found it.
The second most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of tons of growing each year by organisms like shrimp, or <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we can shrink your properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk>  <unk> a lot of <unk> of <unk> the <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the <unk> structures in order to print a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made out of one single material three or long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are lists, it leaves it to be able to find a natural form to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process used to contain <unk> <unk> that showed for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria designed to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without the problems of moving into mesh and if you were growing up even more, to windows.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with an old material, one of the first life forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of <unk> of shrimp on a architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best two: for objects designed for <unk> <unk> <unk> life <unk> and placed on the ground, will grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to maintain life for <unk>
To do that, we have to master the bacteria and control their flow.
So like the <unk> table, we did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> only instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological circuits in very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these crops <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothing, it was <unk> two <unk>
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human brain.
It turns out the light in sugar, the other sugar uses sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, it never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution for design.
To contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like a <unk> tract that will help you to <unk> these bacteria and that they <unk> their function.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to the so-called <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> it will be more transparent.
This system is <unk> <unk> when you fall from one end to another, it takes 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, as <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are <unk> creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the tissue as well.
Think of this as a form of edit biology.
I call this the material.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer looks like 3D material.
You also know that nature does not do this.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home in which they <unk>
The manufacturing is not <unk> on this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination not two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, by introducing those fibers to each other.
And this happens across scales.
The silk worm will come up in the environment, creates a tension, structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
With the end of understanding how this complex process works, we <unk> a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it into a box with mechanical sensors and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of silk worm <unk>
However, when we put the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that we would have a flat, flat cocoon and still <unk>
So we started to design different parts of different parts -- different <unk> and we found that the way, the structure of the <unk> is transmitted directly through the environment.
It's often <unk> the silk worms to death within their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these <unk> we can shape <unk> silk without boiling a single <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we got this process to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot by making silk, and we put it into our site.
We knew the worms of silk <unk> to more dark areas and <unk> so we use a solar diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat up the silk worms on the structure.
We were prepared to get the <unk>
We said, <unk> worms of silk to a online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully at the bottom edge of the <unk> and as a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
By <unk> biological silk about silk <unk> <unk> give all this pavilion out of its capitalism.
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, they were <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry this is also the length of the <unk>
<unk> after <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through an robotic arm, the other full empty arm.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which takes us back around, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which takes us from a design inspired by nature to a nature inspired by the nature of the design that requires us, for the first time, that we take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what old people had when they asked this?
You can <unk> with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three.
Now, raise your hand if the question "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was not that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English and the <unk> and the art and the art and I was able to play the guitar on a gang band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard of us.
And generally I like to test and persist anyway, for having dedicated a long time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to go.
But then I went to me on the other thing, something completely different, and I got myself on it, and I let me absorb and I feel <unk> I have found it <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to move on.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because it wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, deny all my other passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason why I had so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me not <unk> at all.
I was worried about being afraid of engagement, or whether or <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate to my story, and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something that I'd like to have raised then.
They were going to ask themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of bad or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where the <unk> they learned from culture.
You ask ourselves first "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what was going to do to that age.
It's considered a naive question to cause nice answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question makes us over and over again as we go into different forms, <unk> <unk> to high school students are asking you to pick up at college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise before what it takes us to sleep.
Why?
If this question is inspired by kids to dream about what it might be, it's not inspired to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it does just the other thing, because when somebody asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though adults well will be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cool -- but you can't be a <unk> but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor of magazine became <unk> <unk> a teacher and creative capital.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of <unk> life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that every one of us has something to do for their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing and to devote your life to that.
But if you're somebody who is not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that wake up their curiosity and many different things that you want to do?
There is no place for someone as one in that frame.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feeling something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with many interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk>
It could help if they split up in three <unk> <unk> potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms of <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was who I was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> yourself.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as limitation or urge you to win.
But what I've learned talking about people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths to be this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in terms of, visualization of data, travel, mathematics and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk> <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this idea of the only <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
The innovation is happening at intersections.
So the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all of their poetry, you can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is learning fast.
When the <unk> are <unk> we are going to that.
We see everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to be <unk> because we have been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid to try new things and get out of our comfort areas.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring all of what we have learned to every new area that <unk> so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a full-time <unk> and a <unk>
As a girl who was an amazing capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before he became a writer, <unk> was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the most thin sales of sales when they started their skills, and this ability helps to write a lot of a lot of compelling <unk>
<unk> time is a loss of time to be able to get to what you're going to do, even if you end it up.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower superpower is adaptability. I mean, the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos, some other pages of web pages -- sometimes race, sometimes teacher, and sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> magazine, Company defines <unk> as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the market needs -- which really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could lose if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a huge interest in foster <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to do it in order to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> from belly knowing they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams are made up from a mathematician and a <unk> <unk>
<unk> can dive deep and put in ideas, and the <unk> offers a breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that we can do with how we're connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a large part of them will be told to be more like their fellow <unk>
I once said this, if there's one thing that you can take out of this talk, I hope it is this: <unk> with the inner <unk> whatever it is.
If you're a heart doctor, then you get out of all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realize being one of them in the last 12 minutes,   I say, <unk> with their many passions.
Keep their curiosity through those <unk> <unk>
It would be <unk>
It takes us our inner <unk> it leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I went to a woman called <unk> they took a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> by her until she died in <unk>
After his death, she did a <unk> and found strange <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before.
What's even more surprising, even more surprising.
If you would have been alive today, we wouldn't be able to give it more help than he <unk> he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call disease.
From <unk> medicine has moved a lot.
They have found antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> a lot of treatments for cancer <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But shortly in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, they will affect 150 million which, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of every two.
In other words, there is the probability that they spend their years <unk> with Alzheimer's or helping care of a friend or being loved with Alzheimer's.
In the U.S., <unk> care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spending on disease disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs -- an increase in five times by 2050, as the generation of <unk> <unk>
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it's made relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death of all of the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that can't be able to cure or will even slow out their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research of the same.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research that in Alzheimer's disease despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a nuclear number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause of consciousness.
Because this is what time people knows, but the whole world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of all, the scientists, the scientists, Alzheimer's for aging.
We think that will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you just have to look at a picture of a healthy brain in comparison with the patient of a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to engaging a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's percent significantly life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and strangers in the brain of <unk> a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules today.
You can think of a molecule of protein as a piece of paper that folds as a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds well, these dots <unk> end up inside the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some points <unk> they stay on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's patients.
We've spent the last 10 years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are a lot of steps, and the guess what step next is complex is complex as <unk> a bomb.
I could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
So you have to find the right step that we would do, and then create a drug that I do.
Until recently, in its most part, they have reduced the wires and expected the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, biologists, physical chemicals, engineers and math.
And together, we've been able to identify a critical step in the process -- now it's testing a new kind of drugs that are generated specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
Nobody outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos of what happened to test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they move normal.
These worms on the other hand, they have protein molecules that stick in between them, like humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at a early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial outcome, but the research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of <unk> there is real hope of what you can do in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to argue that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we do it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, the patients and their families and their families have gotten more research and <unk> pressure about governments, industry industry and <unk>
That was essential to move into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and night, are often too <unk> to get out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
And they were talking about them, and helping them demand a cure.
Thank you.
<unk> this article in the hometown of the New York Times in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody to do this.
The paper is about a critical study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and of my own experience at using it as a night of last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are <unk> to be <unk> and more personal questions, and then you both look at your eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions here.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or ability, which would be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you get to another person?
And <unk>
<unk> <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like him or him, I know very honest -- this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to somebody you've ever met.
When I came back to this study a few years ago, a really really really struck me -- that was a really struck by what two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the time I was trying to test this study, with somebody who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect <unk>
However, we were <unk> and   And I thought it was a good story, so I sent it to the Love column -- you know, a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably ask you, they still don't ask, keep together still in.
And the reason I think you know this is because I've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before I was put on the article very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had asked me to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog input can come to a few hundred views as a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would be probably a few thousand seen.
And that was a good amount of attention to a relatively new relationship.
But as it was gone, I had no idea.
The article was published on a Friday night at night, and now the Saturday, this was on the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday -- I had been called the Long Show and the "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article got over eight million dollars, and I was, for saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with each other, on their own experiences -- but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called it or he said, what they did every day for weeks, they were always, they were going to first ask the question: They still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for my email on my email with the phrase, <unk> <unk>
And several messages were immediately immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
I even gave a talk, and a woman asked the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately put red up.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the <unk>
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for San <unk> that included the experience of readers at testing the study in these different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be really <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not every request that we both did a public emergence together.
And I went on TV interviews, and <unk> <unk> <unk> of us two.
I think I was afraid that was afraid of becoming the <unk> <unk> of the process of <unk> a range for which I didn't feel at the absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know if they really <unk> I mean, if it was able to produce love love -- not only an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months -- and I felt, about everything, people made the wrong question.
How do you know if you would get them together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would do the experience of making these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking at <unk> to <unk> between college students, using what <unk> called <unk> personal <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It sounds romantic right?
But the study does work.
The participants felt closer after doing a number of studies, and several studies, they also used the protocol by <unk> <unk> as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used between members of the police and the community, and they have used it between people in the opposite policy.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer -- that combine personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, it was cited in this paper, but unfortunately never been published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a small liberal arts university and then a student came up to me and said to me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He looked like <unk> for that.
And I said, you want to say that you get rid of the person with whom I do it.
Well he made a show.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
I know that they were able to get better better after testing the research.
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult separation to me.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to do all my life adult, and he was my first real love and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I went into science.
I was doing everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could be a certain form of the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just went to the book that I write but in retrospect, it looks really <unk>
I thought that if I was telling me with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to feel as bad as I felt then.
And this whole knowledge has been useful from one or another way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I'm saying.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than I reasonably can demand me.
What I'm looking for love is an awful not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but that I'm going to continue to be able to stay on the person that I love you.
It can be that this is the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media was told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut for <unk>
There may be a way to mitigate some of the <unk> risk -- and this is a very <unk> story, because in love with us makes us feel honest -- but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The version of the story that says, still follow together?
And their content with an answer or No.
So more than a question, we need to make questions more difficult, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't it?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with the uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live in the doubt of your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known and I used a study designed to create romantic love, we can still keep together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love -- it's not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article <unk> love didn't happen.
<unk> fell in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit at the reading now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, there was no matter what that choice was supposed for.
I didn't think of how many times we would have to take that decision, and how much times will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he was always going to love me or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded 36 questions, having chosen to love somebody as dense and fun and being expressed that choice in the biggest U.S. newspaper.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really think.
And what I think about and what I maybe spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy to implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I actually didn't know.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose to love somebody, and the hope that he also love me, and it's <unk> but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a couple of <unk> in a certain way, and I came like a <unk> of the forest.
New York City ago.  Something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'm going to start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and he <unk> a dollar, a dollar, a pen and a fork in her somewhere in general.
And I thought some of the weird <unk> or a aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species are <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat the <unk>
I had no idea.
In any case, it has <unk> because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment when I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from <unk> and make a <unk> and all of those things <unk> and I was making a poster for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I gave him all the pages and I did a kind of <unk> <unk> to Agnes Jordan, I covered it and a bee <unk> and a bee stayed in.
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more interested in the canvas, thinking that I could be <unk>
Instead, it happened to the opposite of some way it looked like it goes from size, as if it was the text with a <unk>
So I did I built more boxes.
This time, I began to add electronic elements, diverse bottles that I was finding on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
I can flow out how to draw the way you do about a <unk> on the crime scene.
And I took objects and created my own <unk> of specimens <unk>
First of all, you can get an idea.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great. man.
At some time I became interested in the human form, sculptures of the size of natural <unk> with drawings of human beings in the layers.
It was great, except for one thing:
I didn't know what to do, because the guy was going to kill.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass sheets similar to the drawing on a window, then on another window, and another window, and I had all these windows together that they put together a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really worked, and I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
<unk> feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with animals are traveling between two worlds.
They go from the world of <unk> to this <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is where the creatures with animals are running into <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is composed of thousands of elements.
This is a god bird tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the shelter of Osama bin sapiens, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand is coming out clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit of a narrative.
That's the hand in which we <unk>
And then, when you go on the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird, and it smelled clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> feet of a <unk> <unk> that joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn fire into a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go in, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> <unk> made of Christmas cards.
They have <unk>
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
Very <unk> to his time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six years of six years to do 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a file of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries or scientists.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in a way of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they get together, <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's getting years.
Each one is basically a <unk> <unk> that weighs 1.3 pounds of a human being stuck in its inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That is the <unk> he's his chest, you can get rid of it.
I'm going to play you for the rest of the body -- there is a waterfall that comes out from the chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever it has -- a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are a few pills that they come out and go into the head of this strange statue of this strange board.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
You can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> like the boxes that we live.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physical box, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a writer, an <unk> a <unk> a museum, a school, an educational arm that drives all the content we do in the world and a garden.
<unk> the box and all the people inside it strikes each other as particles.
And I think that's how to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that is living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of the countries, of the borders, it doesn't work.
We're all really made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with <unk> and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first of the stomach, the <unk> and other organs.
So I'll take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> so that any drug <unk> effect on the body.
The <unk> though, is that by <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs that are going to lower the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the heart of cells <unk>
But they are also known to their side effects <unk> in its negative <unk> because in the time that it takes to get the current <unk> and they will get worse and worse than the time it takes to get to their fate, which is where it's more important, in the warehouse of HIV.
These are regions of the body as the lymph <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily get into the blood bloodstream.
However, after the treatment of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great issue of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of life by running by the Supreme basis.
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> making the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, <unk> of course.
If you use them in <unk> for your wounds and surgery from diabetes, you can be used for anything <unk> including transportation <unk>
In fact, we are using laser pulses to open up or drill down extremely small holes that open up and closed and close to the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people ask yourself, "How is that <unk>
We sent a small and powerful laser laser on the cellular membrane with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug into a matter of antibodies.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply to the human body.
"How is that <unk>
Well, the answer is, through a device of three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we will make a <unk> in the power site.
The second head -- which is a camera, you go to the site of infection.
And finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the full eradication of HIV in the body.
Yes. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all researcher in the <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied armed groups, not <unk> armed organizations like terrorists, whether or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these <unk> agents and studying ways of encouraging the transition of violent participation to the confrontation not violent.
I do work work in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a <unk> between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and actors in the U.S.
For example, the <unk> peace peace peace between 1975, and 2011, <unk> was signed up between a state and an actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even have to be <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do it?
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very good for the reasons why they do it, but nobody looks at what they do when they weren't <unk>
The armed struggle and political struggle <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups of today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for their violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known by his suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make groups more than just fire.
They're improvement.
It will be a complex machinery of communication stations on radio, channels of TV, websites on the Internet and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the printed <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups are also investing in a complex fundraising of funds without <unk> but by using <unk> business for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their <unk> to increase their <unk> to recruit better and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else, they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, running hospitals, they put in professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all of these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering the population to offering something that the state is not <unk> safety and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan killed by war or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups for giving safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price rise to the population.
But, in general, provide social services means filling a vacuum, a <unk> gap for the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory in 2006 of Palestinian collaborators can't be able to recognize the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage even in the West, when we look at groups -- we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill up gaps for the government, and they emerge as armed groups and politicians, they participate in violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated ones are these organizations, less we can <unk> as something opposite to a state.
How do I call a group like <unk>
It was part of a territory -- they run all of its <unk> they collect the trash -- they run the <unk> system.
It's a half. It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in the tools not military tools.
<unk> that government vacuum has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put peace.
If we understand the groups better for groups we will understand what incentives will offer to foster the transition of violence to not violence.
In this new <unk> between states and actors not <unk> the military power can win some <unk> but not to give us to stability.
To achieve these targets we need long-term investments to fill that security vacuum to fill that government vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist person.
My opinions about gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the tag on <unk> it would be unfair for the <unk>
I am <unk> but pretty bad.
And so I got myself as a bad feminist thing.
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> and then in interviews, people started calling me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become something bigger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and 20 years old, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women who are <unk> <unk> with the men and they <unk> sex.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at that time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that I could be a leader.
It's going to be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> and <unk> word.
I <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is a lot of self-esteem and dare to believe that it's equal to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I went growing, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
It was the same urge for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as well as <unk> or violence.
We have right to use an easy and accessible and accessible access to contraceptives and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without the need for controls <unk> or accompanying <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to realize our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition, skills and so much more.
We have to have to figure out these differences and how we get rid of the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is not nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear. I'm a mess.
I'm filled with me.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist thing.
I have another confession.
When I come to work, I hear rap music -- <unk> all volume.
Although the letter degrades the women and it bothers me, the classic <unk> classic <unk> of the yin yang <unk> is amazing.
<unk> actually with your <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my music music.
I believe firmly in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk>  all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> of the fashion magazines and the nice stuff.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the <unk> tales that actually become true.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of her husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay in home to raise their children, I mean, I mean, as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
<unk> this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the color of the color, the gay workers, gay workers, and <unk> for white women and <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism for me, I'm a very bad feminist feminist
It also happens by the following: As <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We expect it to be able to get it right now.
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think of that <unk> before you try to put up there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm a fear of fear that it means that it was not being able to be able to fill with a little realistic expectations with it.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it <unk>
In the last few years it's a <unk> feminist
In the <unk> Music <unk> <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show to see this star star embracing openly feminism and to know women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics began <unk> <unk> if it was <unk> it was or not a feminist thing.
<unk> their capital, instead of simply believing the word of a adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection in the <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot.
So let's go far beyond critical criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until it doesn't be anything.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or rather, a more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to give it to action and be a little bit more <unk>
If I listen to music, I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until we change the change of affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why has his music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worst choice.
But when bad decisions will justify this makes it harder for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
These are two <unk> <unk> <unk> and bright girls and also I want you to grow in a world.
And they get rid of the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice will be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a TV program is about sexual violence against women as sports, <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We can change the radio radio when we heard songs that treat women as anything.
We can spend our money to go to the movie in another part of the time when movies are not treating women more than <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their classmates as <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in his magazine, to participate in your magazine, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, and we can also be able to be able to be including even more of us until most of us are <unk> to overcome the barriers to the workplace.
We are not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these little choices of courage and expect our decisions to get to the top, to people in the power of directors and producers of film and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change to create a meaningful and significant change to create a meaningful and significant change to create a meaningful and significant change
We can also tell the courage to say, well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to not be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, mostly because I <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was a incident.
I call it an incident to do what happened.
And a few guys would be asked when it was too young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as it was nothing.
I started believing it wasn't anything.
<unk> my voice, and after all I didn't tell me to believe that I could say something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was going into a stronger version of myself.
The words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
The words of the women who showed me was not anything.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and design, I also found that if it was a little brave -- another woman could hear and see that none of us is the nothing that the world is about telling us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other one, I include the <unk> reality, that I'm just a woman.
I'm a <unk> <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a bit courageous, when you need to be a little bit of a <unk>
Right after Christmas last year, <unk> kids in California had been <unk> because of being exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things of this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be terrible for a child with a <unk> immune system is one of the most easy diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century ago, but many of the kids involved in the outbreak -- they had not been, because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, it wasn't the article that introduced the argument about autism and vaccines and <unk> and <unk> by being a <unk> <unk> by the British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe the majority of smart scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the autism estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and anyone who had heard about it, create all their professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence of prevalence were continued to only three or four children for every 10,000 children.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> for funds as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of autism as an epidemic as if I could get rid of another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask the people at the Center for Disease Control what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic <unk> and "a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who is looking for the face of his son from two years, the visual contact face.
If the diagnosis of diagnosis had to be <unk> why were they so reduced to the dawn
Why were the case of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of the science that with the power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told us a story about what autism and how autism was discovered, but that story turned out to be false and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a psychiatrist <unk> Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital -- in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> worlds as well as people around it, even their own parents.
They could get fun for hours by collecting hands in front of their faces, but they were <unk> by <unk> as when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the base of the patients in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the decade of 1950, as the main authority of the world on the subject, declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome as they were <unk> references to places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not wonder, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> will give that diagnosis to children with us, but now we know that what's really common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had become nine of every 10 children sent by other doctors to their doctor's office, without giving people a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories weren't <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child <unk> caused by cold parents and <unk>
These kids, he said, has been carefully <unk> in a refrigerator that didn't <unk>
At the same time, though, <unk> I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that they are doing in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before he turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, saying things like children were simply <unk> what they heard their parents <unk> desperate to win their God!
As a result, autism became source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
amazingly, it wasn't until the decade of 1970, that researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, I thought the theory of mothers <unk> <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John was warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like black-eyed percent, without special education, without special education and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend ourselves against the National Health Service that they needed more resources for children and their families, <unk> and their colleague, Judith stratosphere? decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They started a prevalence of autism in the general population.
<unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse people.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination for the Karolinska in dinosaurs or <unk>
In other ways, these kids didn't fit in <unk> and <unk> as <unk> said, and they saw a lot more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did nobody ever realize these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the <unk> article and then <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even an English translation in English, but luckily, the <unk> husband was <unk> and he <unk> it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a integrated clinic with a school school in Vienna in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning of learning were <unk> even for the contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music, and children kept their games on the afternoon.
Instead of blame the parents of causing autism, <unk> described the described as disability <unk> of life that required <unk> forms of support and <unk> spaces.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, because I called them their little teachers, and he took them to help the development of educational methods that were especially right for them.
And he saw autism as a diverse continuum that led to an amazing variety of symbiosis and disability.
He believed that autism and the autistic traits were common and always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in <unk> <unk> in the pop culture as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith discovered that <unk> was wrong where autism was <unk> as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the '80s and the early '90s, their changes in <unk> <unk> the limited model.
These changes didn't fell in <unk>
<unk> when he <unk> and Judith worked between the <unk> to reform these <unk> people all over the world to see an adult adult for the first time.
Before I went out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism was like, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> <unk> with four Nobel <unk>
At the same time, they introduced the first easy clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
I had no longer have a connection with that little circle of experts to achieve a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnostics started to <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they were hoping that it were, so we get people with autism and their families to finally raise their support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in <unk> -- a simple, powerful, powerful history of <unk> that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the heart of prevention that one of every 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right -- the autistic are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, the autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that are the puzzles for solving new medical advances -- the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition, human cognition
A way to understand <unk> is to think about human operating systems.
The fact that a PC does not work with high-performance doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> <unk> human brain is easily <unk> <unk> social, and it suffers from a attention deficit to the details.
No doubt, people have difficulty to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still producing <unk> who believed that the <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are in understanding of teachers, employers with ability, communities of support, and the parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman called <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of <unk>
And as we went to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to raise a brain.
Thank you.
