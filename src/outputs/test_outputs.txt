You know what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, you read in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can be <unk> as a farmer, or with leather clothes, and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here to talk to you about talking to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that a epiphany is usually something that fell somewhere left.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle of which I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the <unk> in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare guy in the class.
And when I went to another day in the bathroom of the kids, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom of the teachers.
I was doing it in secret.
For three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a statement -- and in the years, I felt the need to start working in organizations that are fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> <unk> she said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that of adults never come to us.
You could go to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I'd like you to get rid of this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we were <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and we got rid of his family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as adult came to <unk> became a box of ashes and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had been closed, it had become a circle -- and that belief that I talked to you was made up in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
And it needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today was a lot of this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can fast, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I would take them around the <unk> of the water almost 60 meters. And I couldn't think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> on another year after year.
The <unk> are born when they get out of the glaciers or they break the walls of ice.
Each iceberg has their own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to give up and hold them up to the end, while others can't get it more and <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and themselves, as much as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But it's actually the opposite.
As a <unk> a <unk> I'm breathing its <unk> atmosphere.
As a <unk> it releases rich fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I get to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are in that way and they will not exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but one continuation of their way for the cycle of life.
Part of the ice that I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you is from a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's unlikely to actually get a <unk> <unk>
Here they have.
You can see on the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, starts to <unk> the ship has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> <unk>
<unk> of water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so we <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> OK.
So two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much in the details of the conception, because if you stop thinking about conception -- I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and the sperm joins the X X <unk>
And in the other case, the sperm X <unk> joins the X X <unk>
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We're going to talk about them later.
In my activity on the ground on the floor of the <unk>
In one of my <unk> work with the story of inflation.
I'm <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way that people are going to take the anatomy -- the anatomy of human bodies, and <unk> how they have considered the <unk> <unk> the idea of <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working with, for example, with twins <unk> two people within a same body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much more low than the average.
And I've been working with a lot of cases of people with <unk> sex with individuals whose physics doesn't fit in the male and ordinary women.
In the general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> takes many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples in ways of having a sex that won't be <unk> in the common forms or <unk>
For example, it's the case of the individual with the base of <unk> <unk> whose gene <unk> of the chromosome and tells you to the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life.
And then, in life <unk> the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual doesn't have a receptors in testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high levels of testosterone but <unk>
As a result, the body develops in a <unk> <unk>
When I <unk> the baby looks like a child.
It's a girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not about puberty, when it's growing up and developing it, but it doesn't have a period of how long when someone realizes something is happening.
After doing tests you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> it actually has testicles and a <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's not really like this.
Women like men, we have in the body something called <unk> glands <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone of the <unk>
Most of the women as I -- I consider a <unk> woman doesn't know their <unk> structure, I think being a typical woman -- most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, somebody like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles <unk> to the <unk>
That's why sex is something complicated. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain way they can be everywhere.
Another example ago, a few years ago, I got a call from a 19 year-old boy born and raised as <unk> had girlfriend, and sex with her, he had a life like boy and I had just figured out that he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme way of a disease called <unk> <unk> <unk>
It had 20th and the <unk> the <unk> glands were as active that essentially created a male hormone environment.
As a result, their <unk> were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormone component of the male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> anything.
And it was at the age of 19 years when he started having a medical <unk> caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, was woman in the inside.
Well, another quick example of a <unk> case.
Some people with 20th <unk> develop what is known as <unk> is to say, they have <unk> tissue wrapped up in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies are <unk> twins, or <unk> twins, or <unk> to surgery -- it's not to be able to have a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why we get to a number of surgeries is that they're a threat to our social categories for us.
The system is actually based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings up <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have a <unk> identity -- to be black to be black means to have African anatomy in <unk>
A terribly simplistic.
And when you have a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with the <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about the <unk>
Our nation is based on a very simple concept of <unk>
Imagine the amazing thing that is having children who are born as two people within a same body.
The most recent case is last year in the past year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> put his sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to ask, "What test are going to be able to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is no such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, more we have to admit that these categories -- we thought they were very stable <unk> categories that will be <unk> directly with <unk> categories that are much more <unk> than <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with the chimpanzees.
What about <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we think about science and we get more and more in a uncomfortable zone where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and it has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> arguments today -- not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when somebody is considered dead.
Our ancestors had never had to <unk> with this question of whether somebody was dead.
As a lot of him would put a pen in front of your nose and if it was not <unk>
If he stopped moving the <unk>
But we can, for example, we can get vital organs from a body and put them into another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with the dilemma of really determine the death of someone. And it puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe you think that this explosion of categories could be happy to somebody like me.
In politics I'm a <unk> <unk> to the people with an unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I get nervous.
We would argue that these categories are much more fragile than we thought to me.
<unk> from the point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I am a fervent <unk> of <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did, that I find every lot of looking at that musical <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is totally <unk>
This is why it happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> were, for me, the first members of the anatomy and tell them why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept.
And as you all remember what we <unk> our <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue.
They were from the idea that the political power was coming up with the right of the father of the grandfather from the grandfather and then to the son, etc.
<unk> <unk> rejected that idea, and they would replace them by a new concept -- and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They <unk> the game field, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences, that was a very radical thing.
And they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time we have the science.
And it gets very clear -- if you look at the story of the Sheikh <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of power <unk> from a <unk> idea of birth.
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in a consequence of a consequence they were spreading the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement <unk>
They didn't think of that way, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened to next?
And the women <unk>
Then came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the lines of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color that <unk> <unk> <unk> and new <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same with the <unk> <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights that a human.
I don't want to tell you that we should be able to put it back to inflation.
I don't want to say that the kids five years should be allowed to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why are they going to keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two beings in the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
So let's imagine that one of them was born three months before time: June 1 from 1980.
But the other thing was born in the contrary, was born on the contrary, was was born March 1 from 1980.
For the only fact of having been born three months before Mary was attributed to all the age of rights three months before Henry -- the right by sexual consent the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born.
We find other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Let me have the virtue of being considered a man -- if I don't tell you if it's <unk> in virtue of being considered a man is now <unk> from the <unk> <unk> of the Mary that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Don't have the same rights of marriage than Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So still <unk> <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went down so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy.
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time, sometimes I feel like the science is <unk>
Where are we going on.
It looks like what happens in our culture is kind of a <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example: Texas at some time has decided that to marry a man don't have to have chromosome and you have to marry a woman you have to have chromosome ahead.
Now, in practice, they don't do tests to the people.
But this is also very strange that given the story that I told you at the beginning of <unk> syndrome to the <unk>
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech -- "I would start <unk> it provides a solution.
It says we should judge people <unk> not the color of your skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond inflation.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea seems very good.
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we should be able to do this for <unk> rights to people, because I have to admit that I know from some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve the social services that some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more decisions and smart <unk> about their sexual relationships that people I know.
So how do we put the theme of the content of <unk>
It's very difficult.
And a part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
We really want to get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I do know is that it seems to be very important that the United States will continue to drive this current thinking to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to make a good job in the future.
We don't live in, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted by other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless they are willing to be willing to have sex change in which case you can live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context as a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that he had done to <unk> twins and then they would pick up and then they <unk> her <unk>
But when the phone was asked by the case of the operation, he was a very <unk> operation to me that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
What I said, "Well, it's considered the political market instead of the <unk> <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities to people to be who are not <unk> to change the state of the state.
So I think we have to be in the head.
Well, to end I mean I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy would be, or as it could have been, if we had given more participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a laser, and it is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in investigate sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in the way of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all of all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my <unk> who knew that I was interested in feminism feminism -- I considered myself <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most silly question I've ever heard.
feminism has to get rid of the progress of gender, so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I thought about her question, most of me have been like there is something female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, something different between the women's brain, and the male that makes us more <unk> to social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
And so if the parents were very aware of them to find the way to protect people in part of the state, it is possible that there are more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would give us the concept of protection with the <unk> support.
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we have to make democracy beyond the <unk> to think less in the individual body, in terms of identity and think more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect house, let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where you want to live and work, have the possibility of choosing between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new years.
Well, right now, we're far from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth much more than its building cost.
So we could easily get rid of the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But it just <unk> by buildings.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments are already owners and the other half is still going to be able to do that.
They could try to increase the capacity by making it in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have norms to avoid the <unk> and the construction potential.
So it would be very hard to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place, to build a new apartments building up -- and when the rules of that place is going to be able to build <unk>
So I proposed that governments are going to build new food zones to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
And later I found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about <unk> <unk> they would come out of his country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> went through a constitutional crisis.
In the following elections by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which <unk> reforms and at the same time.
He asked him to be his head of <unk>
And meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a huge amount of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that say that you can't go and pick up all the current residents from apartments.
We have a lot of attention to new technologies, but it needs so much of technologies as rules to <unk> and usually they are the rules that prevent us forward.
On the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him to <unk> a link with the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities, much more valuable than their cost of <unk>
And I used this picture that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City <unk> that in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are going to become there and an option so that people can choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> I was called, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, that I was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is measuring at least 1,000 square miles.
That's more than 100,000 <unk>
Everybody <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The leader of Congress came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of <unk> talk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this was explained to you that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be an option of a city that you could go to be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away from the North miles away.
And they also make new choices for the leaders.
Because the U.S. government leaders would need help of <unk> countries, they could benefit from countries associated with the countries that would help them establish and make the rules of the <unk> so that everybody could rely on the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could easily be a few thousand square miles.
And shortly after the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> his <unk> and add a constitutional available to make these special special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis in Congress for the voting in favor of this constitutional <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all of them are in society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass two times in Congress.
On February 17 has passed over again on another time on the other time of <unk> to one.
Immediately after the survival of the 21 to 24 of February, a <unk> of about 30 <unk> was to the two places in the world that are most interested in engaging in the building of cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big city center that is building in Korea, it's bigger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years and getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical way, this is the point where we are.
They have a site, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They're setting up a legal system that would allow the <unk> to be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the court of the last part of this new <unk> system.
There are <unk> and builders of cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know they've already solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to focus on <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would just change the other place.
There are one million a year that comes from Latin America to go to the United States.
A lot of them are parents who have to leave their family to go to get a job, sometimes they are young mothers who have to win the money for just to eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What do you think about insist so that families can choose between several cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you <unk>
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what you are, I'm going to make a public <unk> and it's that I live obsessed with the <unk>
I love to find, roughly, and more recently, photograph and post in my blog <unk> and <unk> and different for every time.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothes is from the second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> stores.
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go back to meet people who are usually my money going to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buy it becomes my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be from my size?
I'm going to like the color thing.
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was going to do for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings someone out of that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of inner clothing.
<unk> inside for exactly a week is all I put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else I want to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And because I don't know me as the woman who walks for TED in night,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets of this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
While I do that, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with the Sunday.
This is a brilliant <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost see a phenomenal job for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in a week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people happy.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just get rid of you, you also get rid of it.
<unk> <unk> of the child that you're wearing inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remember his little <unk>
I like <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you do well with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't see you well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, you don't look at <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal reality, six words for you, <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal personal style and only is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it over and over again when people came up this week simply by what I was using. And we had fantastic conversations there.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you need to leave certain things.
I don't need to make it emotionally to these things, because at the end of the corner, there will always be another little crazy suit, <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and I'm looking at it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left side is the logic and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you put a scale to measure <unk> <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be a completely logical <unk>
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where is your brain in this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these extreme places, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like this -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not to be mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, who just like most of the other quantum physical physicists -- we need pretty much logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We can play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we see our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a few of us who may have developed with the age of the years is that one thing can be only in a place at the same time.
I mean, it might sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a small kid and didn't make it very well, always <unk>
But I bet the playing with that bar of parking parking lot taught him a lesson, and that is that the big things will not allow the <unk> to stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except that you're a physicist of particles.
It would be a terrible model for a particle particle particles, because they don't play with <unk> and play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really rare things -- as you can go through walls, or that can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the theory of quantum mechanics.
So at that point it was the physics of a few years ago that you needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and perhaps because they don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen.
I mean, you never saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit to my logic.
Because if it's all made of little particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I shouldn't keep all the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it didn't.
And so I felt much better if I could somehow prove that a common object is also still the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why some years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip here.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the piece of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's just in the center.
And then here we do a good approach to the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little little bit of metal, and it makes a springboard and <unk> on a platform.
And then I did this almost the same way that would do a computer.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip and put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole with a <unk> way that is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of rare things, but then when other people go up with doing those things, because I don't want them to <unk> or, actually, <unk>
quantum mechanics says that <unk> objects behave in the same way.
<unk> trip of objects are not only people, it's also the light that <unk> and the wind that happens to their side and heat in the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to be able to agree with quantum mechanics, you would have to <unk> all the other passengers down.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and pull out all the air, and then you get it to a temperature of less than a degree for the absolute zero.
Now, when being just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act as well.
So we measured your movements.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, I was alive, and the way I <unk> was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> which is expands and <unk>
And when I give you a smooth <unk> we were able to make them <unk> and that doesn't look at the same time -- something that only happens to quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, every trillion atoms that make that piece of metal are still still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time you're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Actually, really.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference in scale between one single atom and that piece of metal is more or less the same than the difference between that little metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you as well?
I mean, it's my kind of logic that I'm talking about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How do your consciousness do if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we did it, and we turned the lights and look inside the box, we saw the metal still in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, seemingly all the objects on the elevator is actually just quantum objects that are simply <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define the one you are, and that's the deep strings of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another work in Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head that's here and that allowed me to take it.
It took me 18 months and it took me 18 months old.
And a lot of negotiations and stories, <unk> it with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is explains just on this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- I don't have access to a lot of these museums and artwork.
So when I started to travel and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to actually make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
So better than it shows the demo of a demo and then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've done from his launch.
So let's go back to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's the gallery gallery at the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
In fact, I'm going to go into one of my favorite ones, to <unk> the art of New York City.
There are two ways to do that -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around there and <unk>
They want to navigate through the <unk>
We opened up the top, and with a single click, we jumped in it.
They're inside, that you want to go at the end of the room.
They continue to go forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings -- "The <unk> of Yesterday <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign of <unk>
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call <unk> technology.
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million copies of it.
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million ships.
It can do in a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, your expression has no price.
But if you really want to <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something going on there.
And I said, "A moment, this is <unk>
He came up and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
So I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is going to hit a <unk> with a stick with the Tuesday Tuesday period.
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even more deep in depth and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take the image, so you'll see what there are.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're going to quickly jump back at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorite <unk>
The example I showed was to find a details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see what Van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It increases and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> I think I had never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are lots of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online create your own museum, create their own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, you walk -- I've created this function that I call "The <unk> of the <unk> -- we just do a lot.
It's about "The <unk> in the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what they feel like looking at these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all of the amazing things don't really come from Google.
No, in my view, they even don't come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital media makes justice.
And the great question that I'm doing today is, "You have done this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk> <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to make the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> a <unk>
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm an Italian origin -- all the kids in Italy grow up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that has happened very interesting in the racing careers one in the last two decades.
So some time ago, if you wanted to win a graduate career one, and you take a budget and you get it to a good car, and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, one made a career.
This is what in engineering, you have <unk> control system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What's interesting is that today's control systems are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronic networks.
They're going to be <unk>
And as <unk> are starting to respond in a different way, and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the planet of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the world's <unk>
From 75 percent of <unk> consumption and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be something big.
More than cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for late <unk> during the summer.
It's called <unk> uncle <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms go back sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when you go through angel <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end he took the hammer and he threw it up to the Moses -- -- you can still see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> on the idea of taking the environment and get something.
Let's start with the test.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer of luck in 2006.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of you remember it, they played Italy and France, and at the end of the <unk> he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end of the end, at the end he won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at the activity of <unk> in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning before the game.
The time line is on the top.
At the late afternoon there are people over here and there making <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France. <unk> in Italy.
<unk> people a quick call and goes to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time <unk>
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
He makes Italy, yeah!
That night they were all going to break into the center.
There you see the great peak.
The next day they were all at the center of the winner of the winner and the prime minister then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time -- people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and we use.
Today, we know all about the control of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make a stick, how they <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift by the system.
We started with a few volunteers that helped us in Seattle a little more than a year, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all forms <unk>
And then we put a little chip, a <unk> and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are lots of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that we didn't exist.
They're going on very complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we believe is that if we see every day that the cup that we gave up not disappears, it's still somewhere on the planet.
So if the plastic bottle that we give a day still still there.
If we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague of MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detection and a lot of other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked to at the beginning, which is <unk> on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question from the mayor of the city, who came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public spaces in public spaces.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, come to that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a garage, was, imagine that they have a <unk> and <unk> valves of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It creates a <unk> of water, with <unk>
If you fall down the pixels you can write in them, to show you patterns, images, texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We presented this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it a lot of it.
And we had a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it the <unk> <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There are no windows no windows -- but when you zoom in and then you get it to be able to happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, as this case.
Those days there will always be someone, in the winter, when the roof, someone who was there and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it goes down almost all the architecture it disappears.
Here's working.
You see the people <unk> by what happens in it.
And here I'm just trying to do not <unk> at testing the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually more fun.
All the children of <unk> came to the building because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was open to leave you -- but a building that kept doing <unk> and holes from water and one had to jump up for not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about use people to give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that they could have small helicopters in the air and that each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, which is moving with each other in jail.
We could form this cloud, we could form.
This is a flexible screen like this with a normal screen in two dimensions.
Or normal -- but in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the position of the computer.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen would appear in different scales and sizes, in different types of resolution.
And then all of that could be a <unk> cloud that you can get down and see it and see from very diverse <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light happens, it looks like this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We have been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best Japanese dancers of today, the star of the New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use it as input to the <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> as a movement.
It can take all the movement.
You can go across the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment as a farm farm -- like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everyone <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, as knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign is <unk> we can move from the digital world of the power -- the <unk> the physical world.
In our case, this can be used to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions how to go from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made out of pixels in the same way that real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are the bottom.
It's a physical structure in London, but it's covered with the bottom.
You can move inside, having different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, will serve to share the main moments of the London Olympics.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it's going to be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in your genes, they could improve <unk> by a more accurate accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, being stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and a certain of himself.
What about living more with good health?
Or maybe be those people who always want to be more creative.
What are you more <unk>
What are you like, if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people are going to take creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> Probably the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of the <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
What about <unk>
Oh, most of them. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world that would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED stage, but I want to give you the look at a doctor on the subject.
And the great length of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that in addition to the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote a trial called anything in biology -- it makes sense except to the light of <unk>
But if you effectively accept biological evolution -- consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
It's about the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch right on a end is, of course, the most interest in us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with the modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There have been maybe 20 -- 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in its most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin protein that is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, and it is the same thing that comes out of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all take in the gut and the more bacteria that the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, you know, think -- when Antonio <unk> you asked them the <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully <unk> environment, for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you can want without effort of their part.
It's really like a quick way for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush <unk> towards the way.
But by the way, we're a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something probably better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony <unk> of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one and unique <unk> and the human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk so I hope you've got it.
When I was just <unk> at college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental to me, in most existence of life, in the <unk> organisms that are just divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters.
But when organisms look at things -- things start to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of death death comes into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to <unk> that when I was a college student, I thought, well, <unk> <unk> death per <unk> seemed quite reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every time was more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas right in their 90 years.
And one night somebody hits his door in hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of he finds a lovely little <unk> of clothes.
He looks at it and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He said, "It says, "I chose <unk>
I realized as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to get healthy <unk>
I wanted to get health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is about spending the genome to the next <unk> adapted and <unk> generation after generation.
So from an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then we will fall into the sea.
I think that all of us will be able to put in the feeling that they put Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily mean longevity.
They don't necessarily help the biggest or the stronger or the faster and even the more smart.
Evolution pushed the creatures better adapted to their environment.
That's the only business of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the bacteria <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that would be able to do if there were fish there, fish in the <unk> yet they've managed to make that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if you come back to think about the place of humans in evolution and in particular, if we look forward at the <unk> phase -- I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is not <unk>
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying thinking would be that by medicine, first of all, we have known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk> of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment for us to be able to fit us into it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we have <unk> so much that it's no longer possible to have the isolation necessary to happen.
A second possibility is that there is an evolution of the traditional traditional type, driven by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would tell you that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they are <unk>
And as soon as we were looking at planets -- distant planets are going to be the isolation and the environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there is a third possibility -- an intriguing and intriguing and terrifying one.
And I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society but it's what you pick up at the individual and family level.
Think about it as well as possible to be able to choose not just the sex of their <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic <unk> to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or remove the <unk>
They don't want to make those changes in their <unk>
If you look at the future that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 to 13 years old.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of being done, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about 20,000 dollars and on a week.
Not to be a lot to make the human genome actually and be more and more to the scope of all.
They come out of those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they are going to induce immunity.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course of the vaccine against <unk> <unk> in cells of a plant plant.
You can imagine something good about the <unk>
That's actually today and in the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine then just two little <unk>
They can change the cells from their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or changing the egg just <unk> and give your children a better chance of a more healthy life, to remove the diabetes, to eliminate the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then, that same technology is <unk> that same engine of science that can produce changes to prevent diseases will allow us to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of an Ken <unk> especially if you were able to <unk> the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a faster <unk> muscle to allow us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer.
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to be the evolution of before it was in <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100 thousand years and we can give it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to them.
We're going to use these choices in a better society, more successful society.
Or are we going to choose to fix different attributes that we want for some of us but not for everybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the most profound thing about all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what you could do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet high.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine making <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat, I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk about flight.
So he immediately looked at it, and they said, "There is no problem.
The pilot had had the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
Because that's not the road.
It was going to take the engines.
Imagine being on an airplane and without <unk>
And then he said three words ...
The three more <unk> words I've ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. It was <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a moment.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people who wanted to get out and I did not do it, all the ones that I wanted to <unk> all the experiences I've wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that, I had a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to put it up.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that makeup, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is when I <unk> the bridge George Washington, who wasn't a lot of -- I thought  I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve all of what I did.
But in my humanity also gives up to my <unk>
And I'm sorry for the time that I think about things that didn't care about people that do matter.
And I thought of my wife, with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have <unk> <unk> being <unk>
The third thing that I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please go <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, "What is it going to die is not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to tell you, I love my life.
And that sadness was <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk>  And I mean, I mean, <unk> as a small one.
And for me, that was all the reason for the world.
At that point, I got to connect those two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle of not dying that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and come back and live differently.
You are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens to you in your airplane -- and please not be -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What are you going to say that they are still waiting to do because they think they're going to live by <unk>
How change your relationships and negative energy on them?
And most importantly, they're being the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with a lot of projects.
But the biggest thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came to his home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
<unk> has a total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation so that, obviously, graffiti is something that we admire and <unk> in the art world.
So we decided that we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met her brother and her father and I said, "Let's give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he can be able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be somebody important and you have a sure you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Somebody to see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate from that way, they get together with the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented to the only desire to deliver a check and rather than that signed a check that I had no idea how he was going to <unk>
I had her brother with her brother and her father there at that very very moment, "All right, this is <unk> Tony is going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that somebody who has so much in your inner cannot be able to <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer you draw on that and recorded the negative space.
So they go through making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
First of them start with sex organs then with the bad words, then with the Bush attacks, people start doing art.
But there was always a cycle of life in their <unk>
And so the journey.
And about two years later, about a year after a year after a year later, after a lot of organization and so much moving things on one side to another we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we use the doors of insurance companies and we got a machine so that you could get a machine to <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when I talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers all over the world from all the corners of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, kids and I, we moved into the back of the back and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we were doing something completely stupid and when they were <unk> they would have taken the frames out of the walls and in their place there would be <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the head of <unk> my son was part, my dog was part, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
These are a <unk> pair of sunlight that we buy on the <unk> <unk> Beach, some copper wire and things of <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We took a <unk> camera, we put it on a LED light and now there's a device that is free -- and it builds up, we published the <unk> code -- the software goes down in a free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no insurance company to tell you.
There are no hospital that can tell you about.
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk>
I love this picture because this is the other person and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the big <unk>
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of teaching intense sessions from all night, Tony went back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system, and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We had the bed so I could see.
And we put a slide on a wall of the hospital outside of the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to sell in the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of this he was sent to us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time he drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody finally came to <unk> and take me out there so that I could get a <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a certain way, that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a great device but it's the equivalent of a Homo <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to <unk> and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of prizes.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up close to the <unk> is that in April this year in the <unk> of <unk> in the center of Los Angeles is going to have an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of the urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them will be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible, do it possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the computer, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain moment.
Do you look at anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> technology -- I just recognized something and <unk> me with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want us all to do all the days when we find ourselves with something that we feel like you have to do. If it's not now, <unk> -- and if I'm not about me.
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in which we were in very difficult situations and at the same time as much dangerous.
I went to <unk> difficult.
I worked in a <unk> mine.
<unk> in <unk> <unk> and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating just -- fun to the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been <unk> in situations in awful situations with the only goal to try.
So when I knew that I would come up here to do a TEDTalk about the world of brands and corporations wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the name of the name of my TED TEDTalk of 2011.
What it was like this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and according to content could <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But I said this, it's a very good chance.
You know how much people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you would have asked me a year ago, it would not have been able to do it with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the <unk> world of advertising.
And as I said earlier, I've gotten into horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> for something that is so dangerous or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film which is from the <unk> of products, marketing and advertising, and that all the film is <unk> with <unk> and marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The largest movie ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest movie ever <unk> is that everything up to the bottom -- it has pictures of brand, all the time -- from the <unk> that comes before the title -- the brand of the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea, <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is what? <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> it was more by <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the score X in the title but we're going to make sure that all the categories that we could have in the film.
You may have a shoe -- and it becomes the biggest shoe you've got to.
The most cool car that you've driven in "The largest film ever <unk> the best drink that you have <unk> <unk> of "The biggest <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then also to show the brands as part of life, and make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to make the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The final shot goal is transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this movie.
That's the complete idea, the whole shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to help us make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be the people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> How much money does it have to do this?
MS: One and a half million <unk> <unk> <unk> -- John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to the meeting with them, but that certainly is going to be worth to convince a couple of big brands to convince you.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie is going to look at us as a lot of <unk>
MS: What do you think it's going to be the response?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be discovered.
MS: But it's going to be hard to <unk> by the film or to be me?
JK: So both things.
MS: That means you're not very optimistic.
So I would tell me, I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> when you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where you go, <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought that <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means we don't want to know about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all of these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of us wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised me.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And it was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, I was present to the product to as many people as possible, to make as many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of separate media is not the idea to tell that new vehicle worthy that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, that my idea had a <unk> mistake and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was no such possible mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>     -- this is one of the first images that would happen.
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: The <unk> <unk> of simulation or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line perhaps the largest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president of the <unk> even <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to actually actually make something changes as well.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  like that rare bear that still follows <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want to be <unk> <unk>
We want you to make a story, but that <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father was going to get me in some lie -- and there he was looking at the way I used to say, <unk> there are three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's the <unk> story.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that only because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go through my own, I would have to take out of my own team.
So what I started to figure out -- and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends that make big big, huge massive films and others who make small, independent movies like mine.
And my friends who make a big Hollywood movies -- they say the reason why their movies are so successful.
And then my friends who make independent movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The biggest <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you good for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there's one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> as <unk> of the <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as to <unk> solid, to <unk> to <unk>
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Clearly we are a small brand here.
<unk> to the kind of little movies that <unk> are more well a <unk> brand.
And so we don't have the budget that have another brand.
So do things like that, you know, remind you to people is the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman: Wow.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something <unk> <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that really puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you <unk>
How do we keep them cool for more time? With better <unk> more <unk> three times more <unk>
Things like those of the <unk>
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common guy.
I need to talk to the man in the street, to people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the good clothing.
Woman: revive the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors -- so many gray <unk> and things like this.
Usually I wear actors like goggles <unk> or I like <unk> and similar <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part of a <unk> part of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of <unk>
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is less, because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: 5: <unk> <unk>
Is that anything?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we don't all can all be brand -- but often <unk> me at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, somebody who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that brand personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first photo is a family picture.
You have Tell me a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings your way of being.
MS: These people <unk> my way to see the world.
AT: Tell me that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which they are going to be <unk> as people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come out and start in a place and in my case where they come up and start in my family, in West Virginia.
AT: What's the next one you want to talk about.
MS: The next is "This was the best day of my life."
AT: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I wanted to be me.
I like different things.
I like the weird things, I like the weird things.
Look at me from the <unk> for what does that?
What's the <unk> What a phase of <unk> you are now?
Why is it important <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
I have a little bit more about you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
It doesn't have to be fear. What kind of Russian mountain are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
AT: Thank you for you, <unk> Great <unk>
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of crazy things on this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> on your personality of <unk> the Jerry Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
It was very well <unk>
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are only <unk> in one of their strong dots or in the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to be -- and it's nature to avoid the things that are not <unk> they avoid fear, those elements, and you actually give them a little positive for you, and you make a positive thing to you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands is this?
The first here is the Apple. Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> <unk> and <unk> those things that have gone and come up with it, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: This is your <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to get your identity to a brand, your personality of brand, which would be?
You're a <unk> attribute you're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> are like being playful to be cool like <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> fast or <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk>
Or are you more <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
Are you traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Are you a <unk> stable family -- safe, sacred <unk> <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, you wouldn't have control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how you can now use MRI to identify the centers of desire in the brain so much for marketing marketing as much as a film.
We went to San Valley, where they have forbidden advertising to free air.
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there is no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts in which companies are going to be able to be able to be able to go into schools in the U.S.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects that I've had the biggest response or that I've been more successful in the ones that I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> to the <unk> took their agencies, and they said, maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how do you have left? They had it way."
Well, since the movie was sent in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was sent in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This is only a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> or press, and that's not <unk>
The movie is not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win a row.
And it's not bad because almost all the agencies that we talk about to their customers will not be part.
I've always believed that if you get a risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get to the people that are pushing them to failure.
I think when you train your employees in the loss of risk is preparing all of their company for <unk> of rewards.
I feel that what has to happen to go forward is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to be afraid of the opportunities that can be <unk>
Ultimately, moving forward, I think we have to give it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear. <unk> risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to spend transparency.
Today, more than a little bit of honesty is going to go along a long way.
And he said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk -- the <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who <unk> they bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, <unk> on behalf of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED matrix of TED, the <unk> Foundation is a check for <unk> to be applied to my care for TED next year.
The idea behind the computer <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset for developing nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we were able to engage these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software is from a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put a cash effective virus on a laptop that is used by an engineer to set up this gray box -- then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk>
<unk> come to the gray box doesn't hurt the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we find this.
When we started researching <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> part of the <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these boxes -- these control systems.
That was called us the attention, and we started an experiment in which we put our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So there were very strange things.
<unk> <unk> like a laboratory rat who didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after I experience with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
<unk> is looking at actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect is actually working on that one.
If no, it doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say, for example, an energy plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
And so much of you will be able to get the goal soon.
So we pulled up and <unk> the <unk> code, and we discovered that he was <unk> in two bombs -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were armed armed armed by people who obviously had all the internal information.
<unk> all the dots to attack.
You probably even know how much the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you the burden is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code.
We're talking about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks quite an old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we could find sense to this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning were called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
And then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and we were trying to engage them with the real world, with potential of the real world.
We need the theories of <unk> that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> white, and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections have been <unk>
They don't find several thousands of goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant, and to the plant of <unk> <unk>
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I went to them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
<unk> is that piece of mobile phone inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to come back to the nest engineers engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
And we're trying to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to data and its structures.
So for example, the number of <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't afford it.
I started to investigate scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That makes sense, there was a coincidence.
And it was better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the <unk> code.
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had between hands.
And so there is no <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been taken from several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> and we had to go back to start.
And yet, we discovered that both of these digital <unk> were going to be just and same goal, but from different <unk>
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We shouldn't worry that other targets are <unk> by <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that we saw really <unk>
There's the gray box and the top box you see the <unk>
What this thing does is to intercept the input values for example, the sensors of pressure and the sensors of vibration and provide code, which is still running during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these false input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> in the <unk> in the fourth of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the big steam steam goes on speed, you have to open out of escape.
Obviously, this can't make a human operator of that.
That's where we need digital security.
And when you're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can grow up.
And I don't know the <unk> and the security system <unk>
That scares it.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see specifically, specifically, with <unk> <unk>
It could work also, for example, in a power plant, or in a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this charge with a <unk> key as we saw in the case of <unk>
You can also use conventional technology of worms to <unk>
It would be the most possible.
And if you did that, with what we <unk> is with a massive <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with a large number of goals.
We have to deal with the consequences and better that we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assumes that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that the <unk> is involved but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> <unk>
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to be able to take up and give you skills that will make users of wheels get up and raise them to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different from something that you put in the morning, gives you a great force that is also increases by its speed, and aid, for example, to manage balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connected it to the universe and with other things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now in what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, you have to take over their back a load of 45 pounds, and it is <unk> to get even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries in the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage to the back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> human Human <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can give you 90 pounds per way for a lot of hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and run with a big <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my force and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the users of chairs of chairs about what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people roughly, in chairs around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, very young people, with damage to the spinal cord that when they start their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be his only choice.
We also talk about the population that are going to become very quickly.
His only option, many times -- by a brain injury.
And this has been that for the last 500 years, from his successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago, he had an injury in the spinal column, and as a result could not walk back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: This is using our <unk> <unk>
It has some sensors ...
It was completely not <unk> in crutches that they send signals to the computer on board, here on the back.
There are some batteries that give power to the motors in the <unk> and in the knees, and they make it move forward with this <unk> <unk>
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, by a strange leap in the air, at the bottom of the air, it was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all of the <unk> <unk>
Soon time later, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> never come to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole to the last bit of hope of my being.
The technology of adaptation since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs down to <unk> and we even ride a bicycle of hand.
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the <unk> platforms and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the future of future generations -- not only soldiers, but to Amanda, and all the users of chairs of wheels to all.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival of Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know their cousins.
This is the world of <unk> <unk> of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their closest lives.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done too focused on this thing in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big guys, <unk> society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society, where the death violence hasn't been <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforest <unk> and it has been very hard to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> stage of a violent conflict.
It's not surprising that this destruction also puts the survival of the window.
The trade of hunting meat and deforestation do that you can't fill a stadium with the bonobos who are in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure that.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear laughter hidden <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know that as the apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have sex and <unk> and <unk> to drive conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> as humans, they love playing throughout their life.
Play is not just a child's game.
For us and the game is fundamental to make links and foster <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobo sees the <unk> roots of laughter, the dance and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human career.
The game is the glue that we get together.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a ball of ball <unk> and I'm not talking about soccer game.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> <unk>
I just believe that in this case he loves him, right?
Yes.
So the sexual game is common in bonobos as in humans.
And this video really is interesting because <unk> this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to play -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> and the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take a lot of forms, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> perhaps the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with <unk> water.
I think, sometimes we sometimes play themselves, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, and then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a world increasingly difficult with greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But you know, <unk> our ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks like the least appropriate play, they can be the moments that is the most <unk>
So fellow primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together while <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for developing a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires like a captain of captain in a fire body, volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteers would contribute to a highly qualified staff you have to get to the site of the fire very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability to go.
But yet there was a race to standing against the other volunteers to get the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at the middle night, she was standing outside in the rain under a <unk> in her head, as his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just come before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and he came first to the captain and he asked her to go and save the dog <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, for the rest of his life, I would have to tell people that I entered a game building in order to save a living to be alive because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go back to the house.
I need you to <unk> the fire, and you bring it to this woman a couple of limbs.
I promise it.
It was not exactly what I expected but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the firemen -- that that height of that height or less had finished off the fire and walked into the main room for a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden back to the staircase where I met my <unk> and the lovely dog at the front door.
<unk> from the house of the house where, as it was to expect, his treasure.
A few weeks later, the department got a letter from the house house <unk> for the brave effort to be able to save their house.
The kindness that she looked at over the other way was that somebody had reached even a pair of shoes.
Both of my <unk> in Robin <unk> like me in my <unk> as a sense of volunteer is a witness of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of <unk> and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have been made, or they're going to be doing remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this:
Don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to giving, you know, right now.
<unk> food in a <unk> <unk> a neighborhood.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save the life of someone but every day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So you go to the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange -- but I'm a big fan of the concrete block of it.
The first of the concrete blocks was built in <unk> with a very simple idea, modules of the cement of a kind of kind of fixed as they fit together.
Very quickly, these became the most used building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things larger than us, as buildings or bridges, a brick at the same time.
So essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 2030, <unk> came up with this.
He was called <unk> <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to all the homes.
It's estimated that they've made over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or homes.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the collective labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new block of construction.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> <unk> about others to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block that is allowed to create much higher circuits and more complex, a brick at the same time.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't think about it, that the building blocks of our time are reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics every one with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they get together by magnets.
So you can't put it in the wrong way.
<unk> have a genetic code.
The green is the road, the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange of orange is the <unk>
So you just have to assemble a blue with a green green and very quickly, you can start to make older circuits in it.
A blue blue is making light.
We can put a button in the middle and we have a <unk>
If we changed the button through a pulse, that is here, and now we have a light <unk>
We have this <unk> to create more impact and we have a machine machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to deal with <unk> and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make you faster or faster or <unk> you just turn this button that the pulse is faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a high collection of it.
We want all of the interactions in the world to get ready to use it to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels -- solar panels, <unk> all must be accessible.
We've given kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how a light of night, or why the door of an elevator is kept open or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without some electronics start playing with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> --  a few weeks ago, we took a few weeks ago we took to the late School of Rhode Island, that they have no experience in engineering, just in wood wood and paper and we said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that have done, a <unk> <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is a <unk>
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to reach all of us.
So <unk> has open code.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world, inventors and collaborators because this world we live in, this interactive world is ours.
So let's go ahead and things.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company seeks to engage with the environment focused on the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> can be able to keep the video on a side of the video.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, this is the time of the time.
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that we are supposed to do with the government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> <unk> to <unk>
<unk> some members every year and put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of <unk> the Third World sent them into the wild world.
They made great <unk> worked with employees <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
This is a city in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I would find a quote, but what you really look for is somebody to clean it when it stays caught by the snow because he knows it's not very good at moving fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask help this way that <unk>
Last year in Boston had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time we had a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never cleaned up these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else.
So it did as any good programmer, developed an app.
It's a nice application in which you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case, he put it <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can <unk>
I mean, it has a component problem?
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest of 21 <unk> applications last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it extends into viral form.
A responsible for systems of <unk> City to see this app realized that he could use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to get <unk>
It's very important to work on these <unk> of the tsunami, but people are holding the batteries.
That's why they ask citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago is just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that would use using it.
And this has been spread without <unk> and natural ways.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you will know that this doesn't happen.
The software acquisition is usually a couple of years.
Last year in Boston had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that I had done by the normal channels it would have taken at least two and a few million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there is a project in the <unk> power of California that until the moment has gone up 2,000 million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So a application that you program in a couple of days and it goes into viral form is a kind of warning shot to the institution of government.
It suggests the best ways to work, not as in private companies, as many people think it should be.
Neither as a technological company, but more well as the Internet.
I mean, without tactics and <unk> and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution but as a collective action.
And that's really good because it turns out we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that we would get together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
They're not given to the government.
They feel a great frustration to that but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from view.
And that is that if we let the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that they get crazy -- the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> What we do together because they alone weren't <unk>
Now, a lot of people have moved government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The politics is not <unk> the government yes.
And because the government ultimately <unk> from -- they remember that of <unk> the <unk> the way you think about it will affect the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, especially about <unk>
This is the center of phone attention and information.
It's the place that calls the calls if you brand <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He joined the basis of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, you can open the door of the house, put strong music and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So it worked.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a telephone center.
It has an app and mobile called <unk> <unk>
You don't get that app.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New <unk> <unk>
One day, this really really comes up with this <unk> <unk> in my trash.
How do I do for <unk>
<unk> dynamics is different.
Scott was speaking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went to the place, I found the cube of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
He gave the <unk> I went home.
Good night, sweet <unk>
Pretty simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical ones.
And it's also a great example of the income of government to the distributed volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of the platform.
I talk about a platform for people to get away and help others.
So a citizen helped another but the government had a key role.
It connected the two people.
And it could have been connected to government services, but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than the government services.
When a neighbor helps each other, <unk> the communities.
If we call animals, it costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but you think that one is the entrance to the other.
That our input system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government will provide our values and our <unk> our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That is because the government is like a huge ocean and politics is the shallow layer of 15 <unk>
below is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot contempt.
But it's that <unk> which holds us that it is that we evolved as something that is operating in our laughter, that other thing, and in consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we will have to make it sexy.
Because it's where the real work of government.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They have <unk>
It's a group of citizens worried that they have written a very detailed report in a very detailed report in response to the first of the <unk> <unk> of the financial reform project.
That is not a political activism -- it's activism for <unk>
And for those of us who have been <unk> to the government, it's time to ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they have to face.
They really believe that we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't do any government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the function of government so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet, and it knows it's not so hard to act <unk> only you have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of members of our members is 28 years old and I, to <unk> I'm a bigger generation that many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> everyone will talk.
You can express their views on any channel at any time and they do it.
So when you face the government problem, you don't really care about making their voices.
They're using hands.
They have the hands of the work to program applications that make applications better for government.
And those applications allow us to use your hands to improve our communities.
It can be thrown out a <unk> taking <unk> they infer a garbage <unk> that has a <unk> in it.
And of course, we always could have cleaned those <unk> and many people do it.
But these applications are kind of the digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not just consumers of government that we pay taxes and get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask everyone else, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will also be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in the prisons, prisons and in the death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing these stimulus has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that tell you here is impact around the world.
In occasions, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have another way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if they teach feeling, you can have a special meaning to it.
A doctor can do good things -- <unk> if it's <unk> it can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of the right -- my job.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard -- it was strong, it had power.
It was the last word in all discussion in the family.
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with slavery -- the way it looked like the world.
She was difficult, but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit and I looked at it, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
I was so strong so that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> and I said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if he said no, no, I was telling me again, and if he said yes, I was left in peace.
He had this human quality that you would always want to be close to it.
The only problem is that he had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to capture his time and their attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there they were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first I thought it was a game.
And then I looked at her and she <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up with the room, I took my hand and he said, "Come on the hand and said, "Come on. We are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget it.
It took me out and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you <unk>
I said, "It's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I <unk> I didn't know it. I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I will never forget it.
Then he said to me, "I want you to tell me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me is that you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> -- so I did it.
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to tell me is that you are always going to do the right thing, even though the right thing is the <unk>
I thought I was like, and I said, "Yes, <unk>
And then finally he said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that I never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk>
I grew up in the field, in South school, I have a brother for a year and a younger sister a year.
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> gave us my sister and I went to the forest.
We could just get the <unk>
He took a taste of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right, you <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> And you always do the same thing that we do.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No, I wouldn't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me at me.
And he said, "What happens to you? Take a <unk>
I went through the face of the force and say, "Oh, it's not going to be thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spread <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this is a <unk> I mean by the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that really doesn't see it.
We can't get to do things that don't think they can do.
I think my grandmother would naturally believe that all their grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been involved during the <unk>
My whooping died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that we had to do with it, we should be <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different from what it was about 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
Today there are 2.3 million.
In the U.S. we have the largest <unk> rate in the world.
We have seven million people in the way.
And this mass <unk> in my view, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor communities or black, it is so much <unk> as much despair, determined by these facts.
One of three black three in the age of 18 and 30 years is in jail or <unk>
In urban <unk> all over the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Washington, Washington, 50 to 60 percent of all the color of color in jail or <unk>
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system, which is much better if you're rich and <unk> that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth that affects the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger make us believe that these are not problems.
We're <unk>
I think it's interesting.
We're looking at our work some pretty curious developments here.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you get rid of rights because you have an criminal <unk>
Now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has definitely lost the right to the vote.
And if we put it into the next 10 years, the level of loss of rights will be as high as before it was before the law of the right <unk>
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where they sentence for children 13 years to die in prison.
We have this country jail for kids, without possibility to go back.
Now we're in process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They would get people in the death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die for the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about how we are in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it's not about deciding if people deserve to die for <unk> crimes -- but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
<unk> death is defined by error.
From every nine <unk> people have identified one that is innocent that it's innocent and released from the death row of death.
A mistake, <unk> <unk> an innocent of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation would not be allowed to fly airplanes if every nine you would have been <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about history -- I talk about slavery today.
I'm talking about terrorism, the time he started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until World War II.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was a little bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what defined their lives.
Now there are older people who come up with me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you talk about -- he makes <unk> <unk> to the people who stop saying that in our history for the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. <unk> that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went out, obviously, with <unk> and decades of writing racial and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All the time we get to each other.
We are constantly creating tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about <unk> I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome <unk> <unk> without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide they had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done.
I was in Germany teaching about death <unk>
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's well to listen to what you would <unk>
<unk> "We have no death penalty in Germany.
We will never be able to get it here."
The room was silent and a lady said, "There's no way that our story, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, <unk> and <unk> we were going to run the people."
It was going on about this.
How do we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> to people, especially if they were in their <unk>
We couldn't get it out.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these things that are so difficult, the positive things and wonderful things are, yet <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by the technology <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But then we put out those realities are <unk> by suffering, the abuse, the <unk> <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate both of these things.
lately about the need to have more hope, more engagement, more commitment to the basic challenges of life of this complex world.
I think that means to spend more time thinking and talking about the poor, <unk> those who will never come to TED.
Think of them is, in a way, something that's inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. Despite being so rational, so engaged with the intellectual <unk>
With innovation, the development is not just brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also for the convictions of the heart.
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering the <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation for the spirit, a will for being in place and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There is no disconnect that is related to technology and design, that allows us to be truly humans if we don't pay the attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality to injustice.
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the big privilege, being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women came together just to talk about.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> called me to say, <unk> comes the <unk> lady -- we're going to get together to talk about.
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "I know lady. Yes I do."
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you were <unk>
I was <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just the <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Mrs. Parks was headed to me and said, "Now, <unk> me that is that idea of <unk> justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the <unk> of life, without freedom for children.
We try to do something about death penalty
We try to reduce the population in jail.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech and the end of me and he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that time, Mrs. <unk> <unk> got my finger on the face and said, "It's why you have to be very much, but very <unk>
I think in reality, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been <unk>
I've come to understand and believe that each one of us is higher than the worst we've ever met.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody says a lot, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't explain it, it's not that it's a <unk>
Even if somebody kills another, it's not that it's a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people who have to be <unk> by the law.
I also think that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
So it isn't.
I think in many parts of the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think even though it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> we don't have to judge our technology, because of our quest for our intellectual ability or rational.
By the end of a society, the character of a society, not because of the way they treat rich, powerful and <unk> but by how they treat the poor, the <unk>
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly deep topics about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do a lot of force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a very important way.
I've been representing these kids who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my customers from 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so that they were <unk> as adults, as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can an judge turn to somebody in which it isn't it?
The judge is <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
One night very late was wake up with God, if the judge can become something you don't are, you must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As it was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a 14 year-old client -- a small, black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my black client to be treated as a white <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk>
In the <unk> I put there there had been <unk> behavior in the <unk> of the police behavior and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethical but a whole lack of ethical sense.
In the next morning, I woke up with that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or actually the <unk>
For my horror, not only had <unk> but he had sent it to court.
It was about two months old, I had heard it.
And finally <unk> God, I have to go to the cut for this case stupid.
I got into the car and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I went into the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got out of the car.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man <unk> was the <unk> of court.
When he looked at me and he said, "Who is you?"
And I said, "I'm a <unk> he <unk> "It's you <unk> I said yes.
So I got up and <unk>
And I got into the ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was connected deeply with me with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When I walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this <unk> <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk>
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They came up with the cops <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people, all of us, because we were talking about fish, because we were talking about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I got to see the <unk> that was going and <unk>
I would look through the window and get them to hear all that <unk>
He was walking up to here and for there.
And finally, this old black and the face of detail was in the room and sat behind me, almost on the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> of the <unk> he showed himself because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant was terrified of the old black black.
He said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black man stood up, he looked at me and he looked at me and said, <unk> this room of audiences to tell this young young man to keep his view in the goal with <unk>
I've come to TED today, because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
We cannot be truly human humans -- if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is connected to each other.
What our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of us who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Tell me to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, in this community, to help in your way, to do something.
Something that is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities close to you.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which it's going to be an effort for <unk> the funds that are spending in terms of punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death penalty in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the year in homicide -- not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> don't get anything.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are <unk> these funds to make the law <unk>
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it tells you that it has to do with the greatest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who believe this is this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The great growth in <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to the <unk> chain by stealing a bicycle, for small crimes against the property, rather than making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> are you excited about here today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for TED. Thank you.
Announcer: It was <unk> the threats for bin Laden.

<unk> 4: <unk>

Several <unk> War to <unk> massive <unk>

<unk> Death <unk>
Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months, <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media means they prefer negative news, because our minds pay attention to attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every day our senses are getting more data than the brain is probably <unk>
And as nothing matters to us to survive, the first stop all of these data is an old piece of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early alert detector that was the <unk>
<unk> and recorded all the information for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So of a <unk> of stories <unk> to look at the <unk>
That old saying of the <unk> "If there are blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all of the digital devices give us news news for the seven days of week, 24 hours a day, it's not surprising to be <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world will be wrong in worse.
But maybe it's not like this.
Perhaps instead of what happens is we received <unk>
Maybe the huge progress done in the last century for a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the species of species, the shortage of water and <unk> <unk>
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and the long time, we just have them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average per capita income per capita per capita is <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, from power electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy happened from 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we keep <unk> and <unk>
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, a lot of the people who live under the poverty line has electricity, water, toilets, <unk> television, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
We have a lot of this technology -- and then we put its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in technology has jumps into this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the performance of the price in about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things in this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad times, in the war and in peace, in recession in depression and <unk>
It's the fast computers that used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before any of the great challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law on the left, it goes up.
The growth rate of technology is increasingly fast.
And in this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call infinite computing and sensors and networks, 3D printing and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, synthetic biology, the fuel and the food <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was <unk>
I was looking at the newspapers the best headline that I <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not a easy game.
It starts with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all of the cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the life of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every country of the planet, it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that that is <unk> and make it <unk>
You see, the shortage is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
This is a story of Don <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> to dinner the king of <unk>
<unk> troops ate <unk> and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
So the tip of the <unk> to Washington is aluminum
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of Earth, it doesn't come as a <unk>
It's tied by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made the aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
<unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet <unk> by 5,000 times more energy than we used in a year.
They come to Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk>
It is not about <unk> but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have the abundance of water.
Let's talk now about the water.
Do you remember when Carl cutaway pointed to the Voyager Voyager toward the Earth, in 1990, after I spent <unk>
<unk> a famous picture -- how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is <unk> <unk> two percent is ice, and we <unk> by the <unk> of the planet, but there's also a hope.
It's a technology available in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It's coming out of it, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators from the <unk> I would like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator size.
It is able to generate a thousand gallons of drinking water to the day of any source -- <unk> water, water <unk> a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coke is just going to make an important test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence in which it would be, Coca-Cola will implement in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation for this technology that is today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent of the mobile phones in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communication in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to say with a smart mobile phone, it has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one could have predicted before.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video images, images, of books and music, <unk> technology -- now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best one is going to be when we get the health in health.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announce with the <unk> Foundation, something called the X <unk> <unk> of 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the teams of the world so that we are able to get these technologies into a mobile device with the <unk> and because it has <unk> you can get rid of the finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics that an certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the world in the developing world that there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent of the health health workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that we don't want to call the health care -- and first of all, avoid the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it a billion increasing.
The white lines here are the population.
So just about spending the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against the demographic explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll spend two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds never before <unk> to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What do you do?" What wishes <unk>
And instead of economic collapse we have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of the use of 3D impressions and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide three billion members of human humanity, healthy and <unk>
What about some voices never before <unk>
What if we give them to the tragedy wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What about these <unk> <unk>
And if they are contributions that we can't <unk>
One thing I learned with the X X is that small teams killed by his passion with a goal of course, you can do things that were going to do things that were before they could only do great corporations and governments.
I'm going to end with sharing a story that really <unk> me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game that people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein.
The folds determine the structure and you determine it.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this college teachers in each other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people stood up and started <unk>
And it has shown that the machinery of the human patterns is better <unk> proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of innovative <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion minds that are going to be <unk> to work on the solution of great challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I'll give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like this.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as <unk>
It was the <unk>
It was caught up to the decade of <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Red <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> are still saying they're still <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a loss in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The water was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, of <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20 feet -- the black black.
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so it was made over the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had gone down in half.
It would take up to the five inches.
It will take a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of <unk> <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1960s <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development.
The fishing development had been imposing the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty simply, called the <unk> four.
I went out to fish on him, and we did studies in South the South Indian Sea, and above all, in the Sea, <unk>
What we captured there was something <unk>
<unk> right now, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the bottom.
And most fish are blobs of a little bit of <unk> remains a fish of coral reef.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you have a study and then you start commercial fishing.
The bottom happens to be a solid background of soft coral, in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk>
Not the <unk> <unk> because they were <unk>
Once we captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to be <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collect the fishermen every time you go to an area where they've never fish.
But it's not <unk>
We don't remember it.
And we were able to start the beginning of starting to the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis, and we have things that are <unk> the number of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use <unk> images at the beginning of their conscious life as the normal and then extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss of loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the amount of changes.
And at the end of the end to keep a <unk> <unk>
And that, in a big extent, we want to do now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they did.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies -- kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that is very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a synonymous with great fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
Over time, there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> which was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way, is not the way they would expect to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> as a captain such is that captain such is a lot of fish in this area can't be used or generally they don't use the scientists of the fish -- because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies, because they don't trust the sources of the past.
So the huge role that you can see a protected marine zone.
Because with the marine areas, we really did <unk> the past.
<unk> the past people can't conceive of because the starting point is run and it's extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected protected area and you can benefit from the vision that <unk> which allows them to erase your point of <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like people in the United States, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may probably fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of <unk> <unk>
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the Bay Bay, 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and the <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about what people were going on with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do you <unk> with the <unk>
Because it raises something that in a sense, it has been lost.
And so my <unk> the only one that giving, is to Cameron, make <unk> <unk> under the water.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the manager of <unk> and I look at YouTube videos in a professional form.
It's true.
So we're going to see why the videos are making viral and how important it has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when I was younger -- that seemed very, very difficult.
But today the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper in a part of our world culture.
Anybody can be famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They climb over 48 hours of video to YouTube per minute.
And of those, just a small percentage of these, gives lots of visits and wins cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of planning communities and <unk>
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
My God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video filmed outside of his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the views on the rise of the summer of last summer.
<unk> didn't talk to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double <unk>
That's what you do if you call <unk> Mountain <unk>
There was already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this impulse to <unk> the video to it.
The trends like Jimmy <unk> are present to us and really interesting things and <unk> to a broader public.
Rebecca <unk>  This is Friday, Friday. You have to start the Friday,   Everybody wants to come up with the end of week, the weekend.     So I was going to say -- I was going to be able to have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> seven is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw about 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come out of nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask them for those other <unk> they are also playing.
But what happened this day, this morning in <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was one of the first people in making a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of creators will embrace a point of view, and they share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this big joke then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century, this community involvement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation <unk> with a <unk> music.
So that's it.
This year you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there is a version of three hours that has seen four million times.
Even cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats seeing the video.
But the important thing here is creativity that woke up between the <unk> community of the Internet.
There was <unk>
Someone made a version of the old one.
And then it became international <unk>
Suddenly, there was a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a silly joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or 14,000 Black <unk> or <unk> <unk>
What does that script have been written to be <unk> this situation?
In a world where two days of video are going up with a minute, just that only single thing and unexpected can <unk> the way these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who protest against <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit I didn't really interested in it.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by the <unk> but often there are obstacles that prevent you."
KA: Thanks the surprise effect and his humor, Casey <unk> made five million watched and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth the whole new way we do in creative form.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of effect, creative communities of participation, completely unexpected, are characteristics of a new media media -- of a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the <unk>
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
I don't have permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our <unk> culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- it's just the current media, but <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported in the only unit and freedom of their country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that his life had been entirely entirely in avail.
The words, for so long friends, friends, now I got it.
It was <unk> in silence.
He died in the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to be <unk> but it was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> <unk>
My mother, <unk> had only 18 years when her father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls.
For her, life was going to be meant to a task -- the escape of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do that.
And after a <unk> of four years that challenges the fiction, a boat goes down to the sea <unk> of <unk>
All adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the breadth the rape and death.
As most adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> <unk>
If we were going to hear it first of my sister we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the engine, <unk> <unk> in every wave, and the vast horizon.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of the men in our boat, or the engine dying and not able to start for six hours.
But I do remember the lights in the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man that collapsed and she died, and he died, and he died, and he died, and he died, and he died, and he died, and he died, he was too much to get it.
No apple had after the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> <unk> whose population is composed of waves.
Unlike the middle suburbs of middle class -- whose existence I <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came out of shops were the rest of the world.
And the English fragments <unk> <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked on farms, then on a car line, working six days to go turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and to study English and get a title of a <unk> <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and they have an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, not mind what was supposed to be <unk> which was usually clothes <unk> always <unk>
Two base pairs for school, one to hide the holes from the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there was <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> again.
At home, we're going to go.
Something in me <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we got rid of our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother at the house.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be wake up until their nightmares started to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, then I studied to be <unk> and he opened another business.
And women came up with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition and angry and <unk> and kids who were caught between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel.
In one, it was the classic classical student, <unk> with what I <unk> of myself.
On the other hand, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically <unk> by violence, abuse of drugs and <unk>
But many received help over the years.
And because of that work, when I was studying my last year of mine, they chose the Australian boy of the year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but their edges don't <unk>
So <unk> resident <unk> <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist invited to talk about sites that I never heard of, and in houses that she had never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the happy life of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending the day for nearly 20 years, <unk> on the day of every 20 years, <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we got the ship.
There was never a choice.
<unk> said to me, and they don't be what you don't know.
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> and <unk>
And the more frankly I talked about, the more it was <unk> to talk about.
I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what we were living on on the border of possible.
And even though I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk>
There was another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a unknown, and a little bit again on the scene -- and not only it's good, but it's something that is being grateful, perhaps a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy there, an optimism -- a rare mix of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
I would take a small group of people for the people who <unk> <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, he made a giant <unk> of soup that all <unk>
It was going to be a night.
Most of our ideas were bad, but some brilliant, and we opened up with us.
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
After a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before I end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who matter.
Life didn't change for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of his husband, caused a <unk> to the <unk> and take the cause her, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
You can't get it to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the fourth of a hotel in <unk> when she died, it was <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw her standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around their <unk>
We tell them, and we made sure that we were still with it.
At night a <unk> came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why is his hand hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"Don't have <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life came to us, we can now see that the men who would have come to our lives would have come to us.
The defeat would have <unk> easily.
Now I want to have my own children, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could want that to know?
However, I'm afraid of the privilege of the right of the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave person in every wave, the constant rate of the engine, the vast horizon that we don't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give them and see them -- I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is here in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the sky <unk> with the singer <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation of how nothing has changed from the age of ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when the Indians we wanted to travel to a car and you get the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time, when the great prince left, Indian warrior had <unk> I would pull a bow and with a <unk> on the floor, it was water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was a lot of me.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I would take up this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't hold my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic, not <unk>
My grandfather gave me her <unk> <unk> of pocket.
And this piece of technology of 50 years was to my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of hackers and hackers in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones <unk> and the cameras prevent them from <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
And so I was telling me to me with this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than <unk>
<unk> books from the age of 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a narrative device able to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we take the book, and you can know what the book is.
Where we are.
They collect the text with the image, the animation, sound and touch.
The narrative becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that matter?
I'm about <unk> an interactive application for iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on each other.
And this --  He says, "This box belongs to <unk> I write my name.
And so I became a character of the book.
In several moments I get a <unk> the iPad knows where I live because of GPS -- that comes to me.
My child is excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, to those ideas that are <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always turned out to me.
So over here, we have to change the iPad to release fireflies.
And really, you light your way into what the book is.
Another idea that I was fascinated by girl was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world gets into a <unk> that I moved into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In all of the fantasy book has always been maps but have been static.
This is a map that goes up, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another really important thing to me is to create Indian content and contemporary content.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped on the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a <unk> child story.
In a story that is about present issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that kids have been <unk> to their <unk> not come to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our kids into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that you have to go out on the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and collect pictures of different natural objects.
As a girl I had a lot of <unk> and rocks, and <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to recover this childhood ritual you have to get out and in a chapter -- a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
This way creates a digital collection of photos that then you can put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Within the variants of connection between magic, the Earth and technology is a lot of possibilities.
In the next book we asked to have a interaction where you get out with the iPad and the video on and through augmented reality, you see a group of cartoons that appear on the plants inside the house.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves with leaves in a moment.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature is <unk> with technology and magic and technology to come up with one another.
<unk> the energy of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and child love that we sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University <unk> was <unk> to a director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of all, or perhaps not all of all, but most of the projects of <unk> they are willing to do that we stop listening.
This is my scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a <unk> <unk>
Every morning I got up.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I get <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my <unk> doctor has access to him as well. So he can see what my problem is about weight, not at the same time where you need <unk> or some urgency of that style, but to see it backwards.
But there's something else.
Like some of you you know, I have more than four followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect my scale to the Wi-Fi scale and before you climb up my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure from the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also so that patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week being available in the next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people would take away from their homes, take their blood pressure <unk> to their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back to the control and to be measured from their own <unk> but it can also help us care about health because of the challenges that we face, like the firing of the cost of attention, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage the patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did I'd like to share with you with a video video.
We all have <unk> <unk>
Maybe we even have them in our phones.
We know perfectly where the <unk> <unk> are <unk>
What are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we do <unk> in the Netherlands, in the Netherlands in the world.
We created a website, and we asked the public public, you see a <unk> for favor <unk> <unk> where, when it is open, because they sometimes open up in the <unk> and other people are closed.
And more than 10,000 <unk> were already presented in the Netherlands, in the Netherlands, in the Netherlands, in the Netherlands, over <unk>
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an application for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time they are in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks you can use your cell phone from Microsoft to find the closest <unk>
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to move it back to the world.
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find, work and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> all over the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I'd also like to invite companies all over the world that could help us look at these <unk>
They could be <unk> or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in their place.
Please, <unk> in this and not only improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or it's <unk> <unk>
Because of course, they're photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed with my previous passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because when I use the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place at the right time.
It looked like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that I would start with the <unk>
<unk> like this: an building in a very <unk> road.
But it has a turn.
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and <unk> and <unk> at the same time, but with the common goal of keeping the <unk>
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because of course, it's not something that can be <unk> but I always want it to be captured in some way as a photograph.
<unk> where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to capture an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it seem true.
They're the details or the <unk>
<unk>
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is a realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of the reality that we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But they combined in a certain way to create something that still looks like <unk> as if there was there.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's take into the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the pictures.
It's really about combine different <unk>
And the things that make a picture look like realistic I think are those things that we don't even see the things around us in our everyday life.
But by combining photographs it's very important <unk> because otherwise something will be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to get realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures <unk> must have the same type of light.
And these two images meet with these <unk> were taken the same height and with the same type of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect ending.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the lower part is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed of photographs of different places.
In the staff, I think it's easier to create a place that you find because you don't need to put the ideas in the head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought of this idea in the winter I knew that I had several months to <unk> to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured in a fishing journey.
The shores are in a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a stone.
And yes, I even did a red house at the top of the island to look more <unk>
So to get an realistic result I think you need to planning.
It always starts with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very <unk>
If you make a good job when you take the photos the result can be very beautiful and the very realistic.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
Please, if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a folder, of mine.
I'm not interested in so much to show you the details but the general thing.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local <unk>
The interesting thing about this is that this is a lot of other people that we tend to see, is a kind of straight line on a <unk>
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with curves -- it's something new.
Here's something strange.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn out the lights.
It gets more intensity because I write about paper.
Why would we take technological curves in <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw to draw in a normal curve where, say, these are the years old, or a unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I want to give you the diagram that would look ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you go through for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve -- it would be very dumb, and we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of transportation <unk> as fast as <unk> in the past morning we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that rhythm.
There's no unprecedented in the history of technological development of economic growth, that every few years of magnitude.
The question I want to talk about is -- look at these <unk> <unk> we see that they don't go forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
We have one of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical curve. I know how it comes to something completely different, or maybe do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're at a transition from what it used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask me, is: what is that new way that you adopt the world?
So what new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very <unk> if we're engaged in it.
I remember the future that the future happened in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all that we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, along my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
And we can feel it. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than extrapolate what we're doing today.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how it could be that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at the long term.
The scale of time I would like to do this is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So we go back a couple of two billion years when the Earth was a big <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals that would take around them.
If you look at the way that those chemicals were organized to give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to begin to start to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this and that is that, at that time, there were a couple of oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside its inside.
Some of those oil blobs had been a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside and so the dots grew up.
And they started <unk>
So in a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms those <unk>
But those dots were not alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random recipe out of chemicals.
And every time you get <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemical <unk>
So every <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, the blobs that somehow <unk> being better at the time to incorporate the chemical chemicals -- <unk> more chemicals and <unk>
They usually lived more time, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, life, very simple, very simple, but things would be interesting when these dots learned the trick of abstraction.
In some way we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe of the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, we were going into this evolution without a sense, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were in order to be able to <unk>
And the amazing thing is that this system of script seems to have remained stable since evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing.
In fact, every living being living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for <unk> now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of the white dust that I try to hide people from the airport.
But <unk> took this <unk> the code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data on this clip of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and would have spread through the room.
What was the next <unk>
The DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy -- another billion years old.
But then there was another interesting step in which things were very different, and it was that these cells began to exchange and communicate information forming these cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way of avoiding penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are lots of resistant to curiosity.
This communication gave place that they would have communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or that if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community were getting more and <unk> for evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came out so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe out of the community together in a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage we have communities we have communities in many different types of different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't use without the heart, or the disease or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and made more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These began to <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that didn't do more than processing information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the structures responsible for <unk> to understand and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as a <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn to not eat some fruit because he knew bad and got sick and got sick of the last time she ate it.
That could happen during the life of a organism that before they had built these data processing structures that for evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit that ate that fruit structures.
So the fact that the nervous system built up those structures of information accelerated that evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now be confined to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea an idea in the head.
I'm sitting here emitting a few <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in their heads that saved some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated we turn it into sound, in sound sequences and produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, like humanity, we've begun to perform <unk>
Now we spend by periods of similar periods of organisms -- <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing and information.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> computer tape, the <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger and faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen.
You already saw the evolutionary evolutionary <unk> in which it produced a certain evolution with the <unk> program to our eyes.
And now we've got up over time again.
The first stages of the story that I told you they took a billion years each.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain took a few hundred million years.
<unk> the language, they took less than a million years.
And the bits like electronics, it seems to take only about decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that takes its own pace of change.
The more it does, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent computer.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor is in that little connections.
There are thousands of millions.
Instead of that, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think of a level of abstraction, we put it in the machine and the machine with that something else does something that was before he couldn't use, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes using methods we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using <unk> is the evolution itself.
So we put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of time.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million sequences of <unk>
You could run these kinds of instructions at random, running all those programs and take those of them that we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to order numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did it.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that did the <unk>
<unk> those and <unk> to the rest.
And now I think of the best people who are going to get the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analogous to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and the kids will get the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of product programs that had a little bit more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
It would come back again.
And we would take some mutations in it.
And it tries to come up with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in complicated, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are absolutely perfect.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell how they work.
I've tried to take it to see how they work.
They are dark programs.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security of the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they did.
In fact, their lives depend on this.
Once he was in a <unk> with <unk> <unk> and he picks up a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, "You have hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight. It doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that the engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the choices that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so we can run these programs much faster.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing goes and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the turning point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very <unk> to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of what it is to come.
But now it comes to lunch and I think I'll stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that is me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give you part of my false <unk> on that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, we talk a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of getting out <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and use them to form a great team of baseball.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you know.
It's called the average <unk>
And we're talking about 300 of a <unk> that we <unk>
That means that <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball into the field of play without being <unk> and that anyone who tries to give you to the first base, it doesn't get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know what you call a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how to call a baseball <unk>
So by the way, that's someone who has been on top of 10 <unk>
<unk> like the <unk> Ted Williams, the last player of the League <unk> of <unk> in running more 400 <unk>
Now I took this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'll tell you today.
Suppose they have <unk> and they are a surgeon who has also a record of 400 in <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a remote place and one being wanted to have two arteries <unk> <unk> and his family doctor gets it to an agreement whose record is <unk>
But you know something?
She is getting better improving this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But let me ask you right.
What do you think should be the average of the hits of a heart surgeon or <unk> from a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
<unk> OK.
And the truth of the matter is that nobody in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is send me to the world, and I would participate with the <unk> of being perfect.
That never, would never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> <unk>
One time, a fellow at the high school said that Brian Sachs was a <unk>
Such long.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the New Hospital.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my class of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> of every artery of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the <unk> diagnostic diagnosis and the <unk>
And I even knew the <unk> diagnosis of how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very nice. I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> of medicine with the impression that if you were going to say everything, then it would know everything, or the more possible, close to everything, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a university hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the lady in the emergency service where I worked.
At that time I was given to the <unk>
And when I was emergency to go to a donation I was going to go to that patient to me.
and report to the head of years.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both of the side, which gives me a heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stop working, and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to your lungs, and they have blood, and that's why there are difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I went to work on the treatment that I read him.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in his heart.
I gave him <unk> water pills so that I could eliminate liquid out.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very good.
And there it was when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
Actually, I made two more mistakes of them.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of years.
I didn't get up the phone and I didn't get what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, it would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to make a constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even contact in my own.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When he sent her home, I didn't pay attention to a voice on my inner side that I would say, <unk> it's not a good idea.
In fact, I was so confident that until I asked the nurse to <unk> the lady <unk> "Do you think it's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said, <unk> <unk> "Yes, I think I'm right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he was signed the tall, and the ambulance next to the <unk> took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach,
But I kept my job.
At the end of the day, I was able to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was going to go home. At that time I did something that I don't normally do normally,
I went on the emergency service service home.
And there was another nurse, not the <unk> lady before, but another guy told me three words, those three words that most medical doctors <unk>
Other specialists are afraid too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and it is that we see the <unk> patients.
The three words is this:
He remembers the patient who sent his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
"Well, she <unk> with the same voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and at the edge of death.
On a time of an hour of having come to his house, after I gave him the tall, he suffered an collapse and his family called the <unk> the <unk> brought up to emergency room with a blood blood pressure of <unk> which means a severe shock of severe <unk>
I could barely breathe and it was blue.
The emergency staff <unk> all its resources.
They gave them medication to climb up blood pressure.
And they put a <unk> artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mix of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy, and I was hoping against all hope that they <unk>
And in the two or three days of the next few days, it was obvious that I never <unk>
He had a <unk> brain damage.
The family got gathered together.
And in eight or nine days, they went to what was happening.
And at the ninth day, he left her go, <unk> wife, wife, and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The few weeks ago, I was interested in it and I experienced for the first time, the shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt just -- <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't stand with your colleagues.
You make peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is what makes us feel very wrong with it.
It tells us not that what we did was not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad guys.
And that felt did.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would take the things up and made sure that I didn't get <unk>
And I kept asking those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why sent her home?
And in my worst <unk> Why made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
Soon that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And in a <unk> day he opened the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if we were going to take the efforts to be perfect for not making more mistakes, I would make those voices.
And it did.
I came back to work.
It was going to happen.
Two years later, I was when in the emergency department in a community hospital in the north of Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked at her because I was a little <unk>
He sent him back to him and he sent him home.
But as he was headed at the door followed her <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my head change my head asked to talk to me in his office.
And I gave the three words, you know, you know this one.
Remember the patient who saw by a pain in <unk>
So he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had potentially a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not from the road, but it can have the top, and that can cause the close of those tracks.
He didn't die.
It was <unk> antibiotics by the <unk> and they become a few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and then I went back to work, until happened again and over again, and again.
Two times in the same <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were <unk> to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk>
They put an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out, a colleague that was checking into the patient -- a certain sensitivity in the bottom right, and I called the surgeon to the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
He made a liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
I looked at it and when I noticed some sensitivity in the bottom right there, he called the surgeon as a surgeon.
Both of them were operated and they recovered well.
But every single case I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been over the last five years.
They were embarrassed and without support.
And here is the problem: if I can't think of and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this to not make the same <unk>
If I went to a place like this, I wouldn't have any idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure, after fishermen.
Of course in a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues too, and my colleagues too, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg, trust me to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> that they make mistakes and the ones that no, those who can't sleep and the ones that yes, those who have <unk> results and those who have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies who start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get to the medicine of the people who make mistakes, we will be a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years about <unk> and medical journalism -- I've done a bad personal study of bad medical care and errors to learn how possible, from the first article that I wrote for the Star Toronto, to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> Black <unk>
And what I learned is that errors are <unk>
We worked in a system where all the mistakes are happening every single day, where one of the 10 drugs are going on in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where the infections are increasingly increasingly and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die 100,000 Canadian doctors.
The U.S. Institute set up <unk>
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is going to look at each two or three years, and we are not <unk>
<unk> dream.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient with pain on the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with an pain on his chest, it comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story was <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't make things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't get their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we are <unk> and we eliminate all the likely professional professionals to error, well, you don't get anybody.
And with that, people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, art -- it's already a habit -- say, "This is my worst <unk> I would say all of us, from the <unk> to the head of <unk> <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
And their students were <unk> <unk> to go down to your head and <unk> it and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a medical health culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
<unk> physician is human, you know human, they accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but it turns out to learn from what's happened to teach others.
They put their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but a loving way and support and support for everybody to <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make errors in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I'm a human, and I'm a human.
And I feel a lot of but I'm effort to learn something that can transmit others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a <unk>
You know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of elections that says to pick a half a half a half a day.
It doesn't do a lot of a lot, in a week to a week to a group of presidents companies.
The researchers recorded all the different tasks of these executives and the time that we would have to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> <unk> jobs.
Naturally, every work included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Just 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your election.
You know how many belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How do we have the way that they manage those tea.
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing to the <unk> of choices.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know their answers.
When you ask a question, as I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Again, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, you're ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this <unk> level at least in that time was very sophisticated at least at the time.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
It was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of <unk> water -- and this was when we were taking water from the <unk>
I loved going to that store, but in one occasion, I asked me, why never buy nothing?
This is the oil shelf of <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes -- including the ones that were in <unk> <unk> that came from <unk> trees.
I once decided to go to the manager and asked him, <unk> this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed out the buses full of paper that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk>
hall.
They had different classes.
<unk> a place for <unk> right to the entrance to the store.
We put it out of six <unk> or 24 flavors -- and we see two things: First, what case people were willing to stop to test the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a decline that when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a <unk> <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
From those who stopped when there were only three percent of three to buy <unk>
From those who stood when there were six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people were six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, let's decide that we don't buy <unk> probably <unk> <unk> less good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the <unk> of choices will affect us rather <unk>
We decided to not decide, even when this is not <unk>
Now the subject of the day, the financial savings ...
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see the decisions about savings for the retirement of about a million Americans, in this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of funds available in savings savings in savings savings for education, the <unk> program.
And we found that I actually had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that were going from two, to 59 choices.
We found that the bigger the number of funding was the number of funds -- there was less participation.
So if you look at the extreme end, we see that in the plans that offer two <unk> the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that were offered about 60 <unk> the rate of participation went to the <unk> 1960s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more choices, even in that case, there's a negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the biggest number was the number of choices, more people will be able to avoid the actions or the funds of investment.
As much as more choices, they were more willing to invest in market financial accounts of market.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we have to do to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three main negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
What's more likely to <unk> the decision, that the <unk> even when this is going against the interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance, and in health.
They're more likely to pick up things less <unk> even though it would never come better.
The main reason is that we <unk> by looking at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations to try to contrast it, and choose that awesome <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so you can test in their business.
The first is <unk>
You have heard before, but it's never been more than today, which is less than it is.
People always care when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're looking at is that if you decide to cut, get rid of strange options -- strange options will be an increase in sales, <unk> the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> at 15, saw 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Golden <unk> <unk> eliminated the products for <unk> of cats who are less <unk> they increased the <unk> in <unk> by two higher <unk> sales and smaller costs.
It is known at today's detection of today, in average, offer 45 products.
In a Walmart store you offer about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the current world is <unk> and it provides only <unk> <unk> a kind of tomato tomato sauce
In the world of financial savings -- I think one of the best examples that have come out of how to handle the choices is the call of David <unk> the Harvard program.
Every Harvard employees are <unk> automatically to a safe background of life.
Those who really want a choice, they give them 20 <unk> not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They're all <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that are among those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, you can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that it would be willing to offer the people in this audience on the audience on a road with all paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give them a hand if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> Right. Anyone who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew that there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first turn, that in the second but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it look more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the <unk> of options.
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of every option, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very <unk>
Why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average, when it uses credit cards or credit that when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked on <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And in that meeting, he <unk> exactly as a <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was that you would get to the staff that would think about the positive things that you would think about their lives if they save more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the amount that were interested in saving or what they wanted to place in their <unk> <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than choices.
For example, this is a study that we did in a aisle of scientists.
So we saw that at the 1950s, <unk> throughout the <unk> of <unk> the magazines of magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
<unk> Well, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> but you know something?
This is completely useless.
The categories must tell you something that <unk> not that the <unk>
And you often see this problem with those huge lists of funding.
I'm supposed to know who they're <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can drive a lot more information than what we think, if you just get a little bit.
We have to increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
So let's look at a good decision -- the buy of a car.
This is a German German manufacturer that allows you to do it completely.
You have to take 60 decisions to put up the car.
And these choices vary in the number of choices that offers each one.
<unk> color from the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box of <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is vary the order for the decisions.
So half of the customers are going to go in a lot of choices, 56 colors, just four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go out of choices, four <unk> to 56 colors, many choices.
And what am I going to <unk>
What are you so involved in you are.
If you <unk> it always <unk> in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're going to be <unk>
We found that the ones that are going from a lot of choices, <unk> the <unk> button and over again, and another one.
<unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, you keep there.
The same information, the same number of choices.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order where the information is.
If we started with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although the choose to choose the box of changes that don't say anything about the preferences of inner <unk> in all ways to make a choice.
We are excited about a product that we're building now more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I have talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> <unk> to remove alternative alternatives -- <unk> to make it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories with less <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've been presented were designed to help drive the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their business, or for people to work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful the <unk>
And the more careful being in our best choices, we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the years of <unk> in the East East Germany -- if you had a typewriter to write to the government.
We had to record a piece of text text from the machine.
And so that the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a written with the wrong message, you could track the footprint up to the origin of the idea.
In the West, we don't think somebody could do this, so much that this will give you the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer from any big manufacturer and print a page, that page will end up having a few yellow little print on each page that are still a pattern that makes them come from one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to do a lot of this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If you look at what's going on in the online world, we can put the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
They're the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
The <unk> cell is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to make a lot of money, a huge amount of money.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys are doing their <unk> on line, but they do it by illegal media through <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy on a <unk> computer.
The secret secret service, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account from this sir, Sam <unk> and this tells you had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen down.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> they don't know his <unk>
And I say today is more likely than any of us is a victim of a <unk> that of a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is wrong with worse.
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate them the protests, they motivate them, they motivate them to motivate them.
groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months ago, a huge role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who do it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous who are doing to protest and the last group are the national the national governments that we <unk>
And then we see cases like the <unk>
That's a good example of a government attack against their own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
<unk> the <unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
It was going to be the safety of the site and put a <unk>
Last week, I asked, at a meeting with the Dutch government representatives asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> death of people because of the attack <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people die of a suicide attack.
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
So what are the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that <unk> an American <unk>
And they were going to make <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt in Egypt -- the headquarters of the secret secret <unk> in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes of a company based on Germany that had been sold by the Egyptian government to intercept a large scale of the communications of citizens in the country.
He had sold this tool by 5,000 euros to the U.S. government.
The headquarters in the company is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools to the governments that do to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used for the German government to investigate their own citizens.
If you're <unk> in a criminal case well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But now it's more there.
You get the connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it seems bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm a honest.
Why do we <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
The privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right that we would think about today, will be forever.
They were going to be trained in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that are being worried about the next 50 years.
This is where I live alive in Kenya, in the south part of Park National Park.
These are the cows of my dad, at the background, and behind the cows -- the National Park.
The National Park in Nairobi has no vaccines, in most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely out of the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our won.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and we found it dead -- I felt really bad because it was the only <unk> that we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came out of the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value them so much.
So I grew up with the lions.
They were dying of those who are warriors who protect our community and livestock and are also upset with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, at six to nine years is responsible for livestock to her father and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were afraid.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because it even helped lions to see the pen away.
I don't have <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I was trying to trick the lions so they believed that I was near the <unk>
But lions are very intelligent.  They came the first day and they saw the <unk> and they were told, but the second day, came back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So I went up and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day male lions didn't come out.
I discovered that male lions are afraid of the light that they move.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on the way to turn out the lights.
And this is a little <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell, the battery and the battery would take electricity to the little box of <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the box <unk> makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where the lions.
And this is how it looks like the lions when they come from night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> to lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago, and since then, we never had trouble with the lions.
And the houses of the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals and lions and asked me if he could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see the <unk> you can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot of it.
And my idea is also used by all of Kenya, to inspire other predators as hot, <unk> and it's also using them to add elephants from the farms.
Thank you to this invention, I was lucky enough to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping raise funds and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a child in the <unk> of the <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see planes fly, and he told me that someday it would be inside of you.
And here I am.
I had the opportunity to come in an airplane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer and a pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture the exciting thing that is hearing a story like you.
So you get a size, Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electric inventions here.
What's the next thing in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to make a near electric <unk>
<unk> I know that we were already invented <unk> but I want to do mine.
CA: So I would take it once, and you know, I have been trying to do it before, but I have been trying to be a <unk>  CA: At the bottom of the libraries. Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We go to <unk> on every step that I have a friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a small one, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we took all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that South Korea, Japan is the enemies.
But sometimes I was asking me about the rest of the world, I thought I would have all of my life in North Korea, until everything changed.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
I said, "When I <unk> this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We're <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, that we're prepared to die."
I was very strong.
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
At a little time, when I was walking in front of the train, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a kid in his arms by looking at his face without able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine went to North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, more than a million North America died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and tree.
They were also made more and more frequent <unk> all around me was completely dark at the night except by the sea lights in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the developing world.
This is the <unk> river that serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North America to get <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes he saw bodies floating in the river, floating in.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that for the years of famine -- I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I would be separate from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life is like as a refugee <unk>
But as soon as I learned that it's not only extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because Syrian refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually made when I was arrested by the Chinese police and I was <unk> on the police station.
Somebody had been accused of being <unk> then I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language and made me many questions.
He was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to go.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said to the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a official said to another, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North America are looking for <unk> in <unk> <unk>
But many can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Even though there were <unk> they were eventually released after a strong international pressure.
These North America didn't have so lucky.
Every year, countless North America is captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Even though I was lucky when I was able to find a lot of other North America -- they haven't had so lucky.
It's tragic that the North America have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after you learn a new language and find work, all of their world can be <unk> in a moment.
That's why after 10 years to hide my identity, I've decided to take it to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge of what was expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South people.
We are all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of <unk> years of <unk>
I even went through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I?
Suddenly there was no country that I could call with pride of mine.
Although I went to life in South Korea that was not easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the test of income for college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korea in North Korea, some money I sent my family, and as scared of my family was going to be transferred to the force to a distant location in the <unk>
They had to run away.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
The North America have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took an flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to make it somehow for over three miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we almost went caught several times.
One time, our bus was arrested and done by a Chinese police officer.
He asked asking them to ask questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and I told him that they were <unk> people who was <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I thought I believed me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated by crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and crime, my family was released in a month, in a month, after that.
But at time, my family was arrested and incarcerated over the capital of <unk>
This was one of the poorest points in my life.
I did all of them to release my family, and we were so close to my family, but my family was <unk> in prison at short <unk>
And I was going and came up with the office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man ask, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would ask to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the <unk> <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and to another two North America and get them to prison.
I read it with all my heart, and I said, "Why am I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the <unk> people.
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The unknown stranger <unk> a new hope for me and for the <unk> people when you get it.
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the <unk> people need to need.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South America.
But achieve their freedom is only half the battle.
A lot of North America are separated from their families and when we went to a new country, they start with little or any money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice language, practical jobs, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in contact with the family still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from within.
I've been very <unk> I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North America an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North America, all over the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the South Center.
This is Center and <unk> stores of <unk> food, fast, <unk>
So the city planners got together and we thought, we're going to change the South Center for it to represent something else, so they changed the South Angeles as if this is actually going to be wrong in the city.
This is <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, live in a food desert, Los Angeles Center to the places of food to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the places of food to bring more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles Center.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times more than say, <unk> <unk> who's about 15 miles away.
I got to see that this is happening.
And I wonder, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come out of home, you see the effects of the current food system has in your <unk>
I see <unk> wheels and sold as a <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and it's the solution.
And I also got tired of driving a 45 minutes to go back and go back to buy an apple that doesn't have businesses.
What I did, was plant a food forest in front of my house.
In a <unk> of land we call a <unk>
It's about 45 feet for 45 percent.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it out.
I said, "Well, I can do what I'm going to come up with me, because I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to keep it out.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we put together and we started to plant our food of food, trees -- <unk> -- you know, nine full vegetables.
What we do, we are a kind of a group of paid paid because of the way that they are made out of all the <unk> of all the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then somebody gets <unk>
The city came up to me, and in summary they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> was made by <unk>
And I would say, "Come on it?
A court order for plant food in a piece of land that no one <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, <unk>
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the Green Green members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> I even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, let's go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the U.S. with more terrain.
It has 68 miles of <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> millions of plants <unk>
Why the hell don't you think of this?
<unk> a plant will give 10 thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars of result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South <unk>
I grew up with my kids there.
I was going to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to make my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I live my art.
Just like an artist of <unk> who <unk> walls, and I <unk> <unk>
I use the garden, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You see what the land can do. If they stop your canvas.
You simply can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a <unk> tool of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
You get rid of how it affects kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and thought they can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk>
I remember one time that came a mother and his daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and they were in my garden, and they looked very <unk>
I, like, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this way.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people who were so close to me with hungry, and this is just <unk> why I do this, people ask me, <unk> doesn't temes that people will steal your <unk>
What I say, "Oh no, I don't have a fear that you go to <unk>
This is on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at the time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion when I put a garden in a shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, that helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me their stories about how this had been affected and how they used to plant their mom and her grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed was so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had a couple of 50 people who come from, they work and <unk> all in plan.
If kids grow <unk> kids will eat <unk>
If they grow up, they will eat <unk>  But if none of these are <unk> if you are not taught how food affects your mind and your body, they eat blind than you put them in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which you are, I see the color kids who are on this path designed for them, that it doesn't lead them anywhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who are getting rid of their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe you get the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my agenda, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take up and turn them into <unk>
I don't know me.
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to put people out of the street, pull the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening markets in farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
That <unk> take your <unk> OK?
That is the weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet me, well, if you want to see me, you don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about making some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> --   I probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road path.
It's made of <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water on the asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if you go on your bike and these cars go down, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we build roads, as in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want an awful <unk>
The solution for that is to make roads out of asphalt <unk>
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, has pores and water can go through it, so all the water water flow on the side and they have a road for which it's easy to drive and not <unk> water.
The noise will also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very <unk> all the noise.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Look at that in this road the stones on the surface of the surface is moving.
First of them is a stone, then several more and more and more and more, and so on, you know, I'm not going to do that.  But they can harm your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also bring more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see how the damage comes into this material.
It's a asphalt <unk> as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they were <unk> they will be <unk> and moving from the <unk>
So if you drive on the road, you get the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is to use fleece of steel, of that to clean up, and we can cut the fleece of steel in very small pieces and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of fleece in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, you use a <unk> machine.
The <unk> can <unk> especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you need to do is heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> flow for these <unk> and the stones will get into the surface.
Today I used an oven, <unk> because I can't bring the great machine <unk> here at the stage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm now going to pull out what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tested a lot of samples there and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So they gave us a piece of road, 400 meters of the highway <unk> where we had to make a <unk> <unk> to test this material.
So that's what we did in there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road lasts several years without any damage. That's what we know of practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, the <unk> then with our <unk> machine, and we took them to prove them.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we have done a material using steel, bringing up these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the road, you can even double the life of the surface of the road, and you can even double a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious if this also worked.
We still have the show here. It's quite hot.
In fact, you have to cool first before you can show you how they acts the game.
But I'm going to make a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember wearing a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to BBC BBC in his little gray radius
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual in those times, because the news generally <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now I can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and they did illegal girls to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister who couldn't be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way we could do it <unk>
Every day, we would take a different route so that no one could tell you where they <unk>
We had to hide the books on the market bags to look like we were shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that we would <unk> our lives -- the teacher, the students and our parents.
Once in a while, the school came up suddenly a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew from us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where they <unk>
We were <unk> but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan.
But my educated mother became teacher.
This is her.
It took two years ago, just to turn our home home to girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in receiving education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk to not educate their children.
During the years of <unk> I remember that there were moments where I was very frustrated for our life and was always scared and didn't see a future.
I wanted to give her a few -- but my father said, <unk> me, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can afford to leave your house for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will do.
So you still want not to <unk>
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women of my age have more than the middle of my age -- and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from her home for the courage to educate her daughters, one of the first <unk>
He wasn't just <unk> from my college degree, but I also was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, who carry him on the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream in big, but my family has even more big dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global <unk> of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
This is why <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country in which it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, as the mine, <unk> by them, despite the way to a <unk> opposition problem.
As <unk> It's not his real name, and I can't show you your face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went out of the way from <unk> to his village, and literally <unk> from being killed by a pump on the road, for minutes.
When you get to your house, they are the phone, a voice told him that if I kept sending her daughter to school, they would go back to try.
<unk> if <unk> said, "but I don't harm the future of my daughter for their old old and <unk>
What I've been aware of Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, which is that behind most of those who <unk> there is a parent that recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers haven't been key in our success.
In fact, often are the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> girls who went to school on <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
We were able to think that these changes didn't spend much, after the retirement of the U.S. troops
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school and their parents who would take for them, that I see them, I see a future <unk> and change change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities for me, and every day the girls of <unk> I was <unk>
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never go back a revolutionary <unk>
It has spent almost two years since the revolution was inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution, like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a great revolution.
Women and young men were going to be in the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
They've shown a <unk> courage to face the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, to the south.
And finally, after a period of six months of the war and the brutal war and some loss of about 50 dead died, we can release our country and bring them into the <unk>
However, <unk> left a <unk> a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> of the devastation and the challenges, I have loved with a lot of other women, to rebuild civil civil society -- <unk> an inclusive transition.
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> About 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of 2004 I went back to Libya and with a unique, I began to organize workshops about the development of capacities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we founded the <unk> of Women Women <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, leaders, of very <unk> orientation to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and for our right participation of involvement in building democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was more and more <unk> than <unk> of selfish policies and <unk>
At the time, our initiative was productive and successful.
Women won a <unk> from National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, a little bit bit, the elation of the elections and the revolution as a everything, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> of ancient mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American soldiers and the attack <unk>
Another day we woke up with the story of the murder of officers from the army.
And every day every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and its natural <unk> of human rights and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, made by a foreign mindset, and it gets away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all about <unk> with our success story of <unk> <unk> and elections.
Rather, I'm here today to tell you that we, as a nation, a nation, we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because elections didn't bring peace and stability and security and security.
The <unk> list and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and <unk>
No, they didn't did.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> both for men like women?
Perhaps what was missing was not just women, but the women's values of compassion, Belgium and <unk>
Our society needs national dialogue and creating consensus more than the election that we just needed the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the moral representation of the rest of the other people who will need to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it and make it <unk>
We need to stop acting as agents and <unk>
We need to begin to act as compassion and for compassion for compassion to begin to do.
We have to develop a female speech that not only <unk> but also put it in practice <unk> instead of <unk> collaboration instead of competition, <unk> instead of the <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> for war, needs desperately to reach peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the edge and <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way, before it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions has the same root in Arabic than the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> that will be in all of the humanity of the men and women, who all the tribes and all the people have <unk>
And so, just like the parasite covers completely <unk> that grows inside, the central matrix of compassion -- all the existence.
So it tells us "My Belgium is going to look at all the things."
This is what he tells us "My Belgium <unk> on my <unk>
They are going to all be <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a real question that has a equally similar answer.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is that they all do a <unk> Why is it all the way it is.
Why would anyone stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, and not a social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, I had just <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York and my first job as a writer and editor in the <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my soul <unk> to me with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man who loved more than nobody in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times as I can remember.
So I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a political trap.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical example of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for the <unk> list, <unk> between them Johnson and Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington Washington <unk>
I have almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all of the <unk> all the religions -- all of the income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse is only happening in <unk> relations and long duration or said differently, in the families, the last place where we would want or we would expect to find <unk> which is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that was going to be a man who loves him, and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States, women in between 16 and 24 years old they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and more than 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about violence giving their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold, <unk> night of January.
I was sitting on my side in New York subway and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had also had a university of <unk> <unk> and who worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a field of the field.
I had a lot of big <unk> and a <unk> <unk> wheat and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the mate.
He did it all over the beginning <unk> in a <unk>
We started getting out and loved everything from me, who was ready that had gone to Harvard, I put passion to help teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as no one had ever done before.
And it was why the <unk> in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much importance for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go from New York and leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to ask him better for your partner -- so I <unk> left my work and <unk> and I went together to Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering a head of a physical supply, and financial <unk>
The next step in our domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it does.
And here is where they go into the scene of those <unk>
So as soon as we moved to New England you know, that site where they were supposed to be so confident -- I had to feel so safe to get out three <unk>
One had in the <unk> of the car.
Another one <unk> under the pillow in our bed and third always in their pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma that lived in small.
I needed to feel sure.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never got rid of my hand, my life was already serious danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my girlfriend out of my mother and married me with him.
Despite what had happened, he was sure that they were happy in forever, because I loved him, and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just had a lot of sense of the wedding and by the fact of making a family with me.
He had been a isolated accident, and I never would make any harm.
I spent two times more on our moon.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that we had several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple days later, driving back from our childhood moon <unk> by traffic and threw up a Big Mac to the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some time in their life, and the Center for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
To go back to my question: Why would I get <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was holding me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply <unk> man and was the only person in the world that could help <unk> to face their <unk>
The other question that everybody does it is, why don't you just get <unk>
Why don't I get <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do -- because we are the victims, we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to leave a <unk>
Because the last phase of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of domestic violence happen after the victim has ever finished the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent records, even after the <unk> has gone back to married, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family court system to <unk> the victim and their children, who are normally forced by judges to spend time they didn't get to their mother.
And we still keep asking why it's simply not <unk>
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> he was going to beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed if he was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everyone the world: to the police, my neighbors, my friends and family friends and family to complete strangers, and I'm here today because all of you.
We have the tendency to <unk> the victims as headlines as headlines -- women -- women -- <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people is a way to say "The guilt is it by <unk> as if the victims <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also learned that they learned a lesson from what happened to them and that they <unk> their lives and happy as <unk> wives and mothers, completely free from violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic domestic violence.
I got married with a cute man and kind of, and we have these three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to get to have never more, would ever be a Catholic gun pointed out to my head in the hands of somebody who says I will.
At this moment, they are thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> what stupid <unk> but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people, who are listening to me right now, who are being <unk> or that they were <unk> or they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting his daughter, to his sister, to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy crazy love by breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last petition to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
Human abuse only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence just putting light on it.
We need the victims of the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the <unk> of the light talking about it with his children, their colleagues of work, their friends and family.
<unk> his vision of survivors as a fantastic and <unk> and <unk> future.
<unk> the <unk> signs of violence to intervene consciously, to stop their climb and show the victims of a safe.
Together, we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis -- safe and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call it Cameron <unk> and for a while, I am a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this moment there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have been dressed like this.  Luckily, I've brought him clothes to <unk>
This is the first head of clothes on a <unk> and so you have a lot of kind of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they were <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but I'll find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about as only 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to get this guy out of the head, because it's when you get fun of me, so you don't do anything while you cover my head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope that not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I would take your back and that <unk> the kid.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one that I did two days ago for work, there are very little things that we can do to transform our mind, which, although shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I am a model, because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do it, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, <unk> I was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery -- and I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry which are biologically programmed to <unk> we also have been associated with a high and <unk> meaning to the <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> heritage that I've known to take to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience that now shows <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> <unk> that are <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing much of models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York City told all and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- only <unk> is to say, less than four percent, not white <unk>
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is, I don't know, I don't know.
But then what I would really tell you about every one of these girls is, why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States -- or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> and poet, which would be impressive, because you are the first.
If after this spectacular list. I still said, "No, no, no, no, I want to be model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the head of <unk> magazine or American <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that most of you want to be a model to say that you want to win the lottery when you be larger.
It's out of your control, it's surprising, and it's not a work that you can choose.
I'm going to demonstrate all of what I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike <unk> surgery can be <unk> right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Sadly, once you've got your studies, and you have a hardware and a lot of jobs to your back, no matter what you would think about is to say, if you think that you want to be president of the United States for 10 years, people would look weird.
The next question that people always ask me is if all of the photos are <unk>
And yes, it pretty much <unk> all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal terrain but it was a little girl.
So I was used to my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am in a <unk> party, a few days before the pictures for the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize that I'm not myself in those photos.
These are creations of a professional group, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is, <unk> things for it for this one.
I have too much 20 inches and that I would never use, except for the previous couple of them, but the privilege I get in the real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped a red light in red and, of course, we were <unk> and <unk> an agent in order to be able to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privilege for me -- not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for its mind no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of the <unk> teenagers who stood up and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
But how many times are I <unk> and <unk>
When I was looking for this talk, I found out that at 53 percent of the age of 13 girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes to the 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer you expect is: If you're a little bit more thin and you have the brightest hair and you feel very happy and I say.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe this is how you get it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to go, and also incredible to be able to work with creative people, clever and education.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is this: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about me every day.
And if you ever ask, with some more thin legs and the most bright hair will be happier.
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the <unk> legs and the <unk> and the more the <unk> but probably the women physically <unk> on the planet.
But especially it was hard to look at a situation of race and gender oppression when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something to retain this talk, I hope that everybody gets more comfortable to recognize the power of the image of the image that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since I was most enough to hold a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 <unk> photos -- and I was not me who <unk>
There was no <unk> <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even a minimum bit of the lighting in it.
In fact, most of them were taken from random.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the <unk>
He took the chance we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to pull the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take <unk> to New York in a <unk> journey, and you keep the <unk>
So here is when we started asking the tourists that they were going to do that picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has been denied and fortunately, no one has been denied with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much the life would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a girl five years could be understood.
These pictures are much more than a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a week of October and to think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not only the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we always took the same picture, our slide changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through their eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
Recently, in one of the travel, we were walking walking, when a sudden, he stopped in the dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the toy store that <unk> from small <unk>
And I described to me what I felt about five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> that remembered his heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first nine years ago.
And now what looks at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created is the memories.
So I want to share the idea of being actively being actively able to be actively able to be actively able to be actively able to be actively able to be actively able to be actively able to be actively being able to be actively able to share the idea of being actively being actively in creating memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't get out in a lot of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that comes out of the picture.
Today I want to encourage everyone to appear in the picture, and I didn't get to get up to somebody and said, you get a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk> birds.
First, why are you so bad <unk>
It's also been associated with Disney laughter <unk> as a silly silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it.
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment.  The <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   And so my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World who are mainly in <unk> as the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the U.S. World -- where we have 16 species.
So why are the <unk> they are important? First, they provide ecological services <unk>
They're our natural garbage <unk>
It would take the solutions to bone.
They help killing all the bacteria. They help them absorb the sound that is not going to be used to be used and cause huge losses to livestock and disease in other animals.
Now, recent studies have shown that in areas where there is no <unk> the cadavers take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge similarities in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge <unk>
They've been associated with the old culture of <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of the <unk> and maternity and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the High and the Under in Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the Tasmanian goddess of the Tasmanian devil <unk>
In <unk> culture, they do a few very important <unk> in the open <unk> in places like Tibet -- there is no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that you're being found, is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> communities -- use this venom against predators, and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critical <unk> list.
This drug has been banned to use veterinarian in India and have taken a line.
Because there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs has a huge <unk> of time to <unk> The number of rage has increased in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind parks in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up of the <unk> lake <unk>
I'm not against wind, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds.
They're <unk>
In Western Africa, there is a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine the basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel by different countries, so you can focus on a solutions that is not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments in the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We are talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we <unk>
How can they? It can become active to make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you, we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you get out of this room, they tell them about <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors about <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said he changed the opinion because he saw them flying without effort, without energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and all I do <unk> my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young people, but I don't am.  I worked on Zambia, Kenya, Costa de <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a <unk> NGO and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
And we went to the 21, that the Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that we would do is <unk>
So our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people from country to grow food.
So we get with seeds <unk> to the south of country to this absolutely magnificent Valley that drops into the <unk> River, and we teach the local grow tomatoes Italians and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, by what they were going to do to come to work, and sometimes they were going to be able to come to work, and sometimes they weren't <unk>  We were still in the local valley, they hadn't had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't see anything, we just said, "Thank God that we are here."  We spend time to save the people in the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa became <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato would grow to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling them to the <unk> look at how easy the <unk>
When the tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red at night in the night at the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you say, "You're never <unk>
I thought only of us the Italians would make mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, what the Americans were doing -- what the man did, and then see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
You can see the <unk>  <unk> to look at the waste that we would join the <unk> people in Africa.
You want to read a book, reading <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist, <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, countries, Western countries, we've delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about harm that that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from a African woman, the damage we've done.
The Western ones are <unk> 50 <unk> and we treat people just two things: or the <unk> or we are <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
I try to deal with any of a different culture as if they were my children, "I want to be a lot.
<unk> I try all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
So the white people in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The little little one is <unk> written by <unk> who said about economic development, if people don't want to be <unk>
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the ground and said, we can -- you can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to be 27 years to just respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start with anything, you will never give anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what are you going to do this?
It would never come to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people in the <unk>
We don't work from the offices.
We got together in a coffee. We got together in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for their own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we helped them find the knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why no, for once, for one time, they were <unk> but not in <unk>
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the <unk>
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never say, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a opportunity have got in.
So planning has this blind.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't go to their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to you, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor from the company, the family doctor in the business, who sets with you in your house, on the kitchen table, and that helps it to find the resources to transform their passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city from Western Australia ...
I was making a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this junk junk that we get to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects, and the government came to me to ask, "How can you do that?
How can I do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
I was <unk> and --   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We have done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped start 40,000 business.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of me.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> of history passed away from '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before being involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says Peter <unk> "The planning is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of death of the <unk>
So now <unk> rebuilding <unk> <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come up with you.
You have to offer you, privacy, has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then they will come up with mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and <unk>
What do you have <unk> more of this tomorrow?
People <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneur is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution <unk> fossil fossils -- and at one point, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to think about is how <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable form.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a wonderful story that I read in a small magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> came together with this group of people, and I was able to ask what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population is growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million hormone, and the manure produced for six million horses would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk>  And so, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that we would put in New York City.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States showed up <unk> manufacturers <unk> <unk>
And the idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few of them <unk> factories in <unk>
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you."
In another way, they won't come to talk with you.
And then you have to offer you a certain thing, dedicated <unk>
And then you'll have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the biggest company has to be able to do three things -- the product you want to sell to you has to be fantastic, you have to tell a fantastic marketing and you have to tell a fantastic <unk>
Do you know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that I can do, sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is not born.
We've looked at the 100 <unk> companies in the world -- <unk> <unk> Ford, all new companies -- Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: None of it was started by one person.
You would never know the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
Nobody begins a company alone.
So, we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from an environment of small businesses in <unk> in bars along with their dedicated dozen people who will do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who is talking about this <unk> somebody who talks about to you, what need to do?"
What can you do? You can do it?
Well, you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do this."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
They can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't really spend a lot of knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much my neighbors are for their <unk>
How can we pay and ask more things without calling the door at a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand better our <unk>
How are we going to share more our hopes to the cows so that our communities can reflect our needs.
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries ago, and I trust a city.
And there is always going to fight the music.  There's a <unk> in New <unk>   The city has one of the most beautiful neurons in the world, but also one with the highest amount of U.S. <unk>
I live close to this house and thought how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and <unk>
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And this has made me a deep gratitude for the time and lived and lived and this was a profound gratitude for the time.
He gave the significant things about my life today.
But I want to keep this look in my everyday life.
I think it's easy to be able to catch over day and will forget the really important thing for one.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant <unk> and he painted on her phrases for <unk> Before she died <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment but the next day the wall was filled with it and kept <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die of dying I want to be <unk>  Before I die I want to sit on <unk> on the <unk> line.
Before she died for millions of people."
Before I die I want to plant a <unk>
Before I die I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I die to die I want to give you a better time.
Before I die I want to go to the rescue rescue.
Before dying I want to be completely myself."
This space abandoned became <unk> and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about giving the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year, and I started receiving hundreds of messages from people who wanted to make a wall in their community in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center, we made a kit and now have been made in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
Together, we showed the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of contaminants in the rising is more important than ever, to find the ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is very short and easily.
The death is something that we often avoid talking, or even think, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that we were getting more power.
If you think of death <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better than individuals and as a community and more media to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us can't only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today I have a single difference.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 years old, it's high and very <unk>
I'm not talking about it, but you get joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
You share it <unk> it happens what happens.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't matter to religious differences and look at this: it's never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to talk about the words that I wouldn't even see me, it reminds me one thing: how little we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that needs to be the unknown.
Samuel he's 16 years old. It's very <unk>
<unk> <unk> memory.
However, it's an unexpected memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it remembers the year when I came out every single songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, he would be able to be able to be able to do it in my arm during the first episode of <unk>
It doesn't look like?
But most people don't agree with.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what led to my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though they didn't consider them inside the <unk> that could only mean one thing: which was <unk> autistic people.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes even physical skills.
In each individual it looks like a different way of there that <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that faster increases in the world, there's no cause of <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new being in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play as the other babies and, in fact, didn't seem very interested in myself.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that had between <unk>
As it was growing up, it would come back more different, and the differences are made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> had something really <unk> a pure nature, a kid who saw the world without <unk> a human being had never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments where they would wish they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that wouldn't want to change the normal.
<unk> happens by the beauty that give us differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what is right.
If I could take a single thing to <unk> and Sam and you would be that you don't have to be normal.
You can be extraordinary.
Because autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in your inside and honestly, the search for <unk> is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time when we try to be like others.
Please tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit about what it must have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a professor of communications, which gave a kind of communication to students in engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> of real <unk> of these students with their great minds, their great books and their great <unk> words.
But when those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt when I had those conversations with students, I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a big communication.
We need a big communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to environment and health care and health care and health care -- and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility for us to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and that its engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
We don't tell us simply to study the <unk> but study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you are describing their science for the <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> affordable is not the same thing that they do.
Instead, as Einstein, as Einstein, said everything as easy as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without sharing ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- they're ways to connect and stick with their content.
And when you present their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you ever wondered why they are called <unk>  What do you do the <unk> and they do <unk> and they <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's supported too much in the area of the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that really inspired the only <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphics that we would bring to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what they were <unk>
I think these are just some key to help everybody else open the door and see the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, through all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all of the Oxford English <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was a <unk> <unk> of the 19th century that defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that I search for a public charge without whether it's platform -- platform or principle, and that, when he arrived, you get it for the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to master the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that Parliament were allowed to quote the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was thanks to the courage of a guy with the <unk> name of <unk> <unk> who faced the <unk>
They put him in the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had such a popular support in London I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's a literal way.
It's not. It's for a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how the words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, your leader.
They didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were presented to all kinds of suggestions that might be <unk>
Some wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the U.S. <unk> <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some simply wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk> quality.
And they didn't even have the idea that you had the idea that you could be elected King for a given term.
And I could have <unk>
The whole world got tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper from a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
Which caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of dying was against the <unk>
<unk> House didn't want Washington to get away from power.
They didn't want to call him the King of if he would give him to him or his <unk> ideas.
And so they wanted to give the most <unk> more <unk> and more unfortunate title that we had happened.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. There was no longer the title.
It was like the president of a day."
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were presidents <unk> of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a <unk> degree.
And that's why the Senate is <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet <unk> <unk>
"And who will be serious with a kind of ridiculous title and <unk> like President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk>
President Barack Obama is lucky to keep there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that one measure is <unk>  <unk> possible for us to keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and this is the most important thing, and I want to tell you, is that the president of President of America does not sound all as modest in the day, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads to note, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of air vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story has gotten to the title of <unk>
So I finally won the <unk>
They got their <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a <unk>
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the kind of 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end the Senate won and the House of <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that they're now President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
The politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control the reality, but really, really change the words that they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to a foot under land in a illegal mine.
The air is under heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak to you, but above all, that journey of <unk> male and stones are <unk> with the tools.
As everybody else, I carry a cheap headaches of light -- they saved her head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely tell the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in the subway <unk>
I got my hand out, and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met days before, who lost the control and fell down there -- there's a hundred meters in that toilet.
As I talk to you today, these men are in the deep of that hole in the risk of their lives without paying a reward and often dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home, but they probably never will.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six countries, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only <unk> in the fabric of <unk>
Among all the amazing people that I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO that has been done to eradicate modern slavery to eradicate modern slavery for it.
We started talking about slavery and really, I began to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not such a grade.
When we end up talking to me, I felt very uncomfortable -- I honestly was trying to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me a <unk> and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of the <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery again.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
For some, I was even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there is now more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much as the number of African Africans during all about <unk> <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a slave slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50 <unk>
However, you can spend entire families in entire families for generations of <unk>
Clearly, the slavery makes profit from over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
A lot of have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to then discover that they're forced to work without paying under threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery is working on the <unk> the goods produced by slave they have value, but those are produced are disposable people.
<unk> exists in almost everybody and yet it's illegal throughout the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the <unk>
This strange show and it was just like entering the old Egypt or <unk> <unk>
<unk> on a temperature of 54 C, men, women, children, in fact, entire families -- in a heavy <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in their heads, until 18 at the time, and they take them from the <unk> <unk> to trucks that are hundreds of feet.
<unk> by the <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no <unk> not to drink, not to drink, and the severe <unk> made it be pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the powder that my camera became too hot to the way, and he stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and sitting there, and I was sitting there, my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
Back in the buses I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was very quickly grabbed to me and said, <unk> Don't do it here."
And it explained to me very clearly to prove emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct aid.
I couldn't give you any money, anything.
I wasn't citizen of that country.
He could put them in a worse situation that they were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and working inside the system by their liberation and trust that we would get it.
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found children carrying stones for miles per <unk> to trucks that were waiting down.
Those great <unk> were more heavy than children who were racing and children and <unk> to their heads with <unk> <unk> made out of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 to 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all his life.
They have nothing to do with it?
When these villagers were holding their freedom, the <unk> had <unk> their homes.
When you hear the word slavery we often think of sexual traffic and because of this global consciousness, I told me that it would be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been known to <unk> sex.
It led me to some stairs <unk> that gave this <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as it is known in the craft, they are local for forced prostitution as well.
They have small rooms -- private rooms where <unk> <unk> with their girls and kids, some of just seven years -- they're forced to <unk> customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and <unk> identified by a painted number in the wall and divided through a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
On the <unk> I remember making sense of a <unk> <unk> and, in that moment, I could barely imagine what it must be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs for where they <unk>
There was no doors.
There was no windows big enough to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we use a very difficult subject -- it's important to point out that slavery even sexual traffic happens around us.
There are hundreds of people in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as a sex <unk>
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to the labor of labor <unk>
I went to Indian villages in which there were entire families going to do in the trade of silk.
This is a family portrait of it.
The hands of black hands are from the father, the blue <unk> and red, of his children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> silk in the liquid to <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My name's telling me their stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, though, that we can get out of this home one day and go to another place where we really pay us our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children <unk> in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a quick look at it.
I saw what it seemed to be a family family in a boat, two older brothers -- some younger kids, some younger kids, it makes sense.
<unk> were all <unk>
The kids are separated from their families and <unk> and forced them to work on these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling in the water.
<unk> branches from the trees <unk> in Lake <unk> often spread networks and children, <unk> and fear, the water is thrown into the water to release the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
By fear of her love is not going to flee and like all life has been treated with <unk> <unk> it tries to be the younger slave under their charge.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when I was <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from the one one of the one of the time.
<unk> and <unk>
And you can point out that these networks weigh over 400 kilos when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi <unk>
Who will be because somebody decided to make the difference in their life?
I went through a road in Ghana with partners with <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with her <unk> and <unk> our car and played the window.
It asked us to take it out of a land path to the forest.
At the end of the way, we would get out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out quickly.
Then he pointed out this path barely visible and said, "This is the path, this is the way.
And as we started to turn away from the <unk> that <unk> the path and after walking close to an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the team of photos on my head as I put on these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> road ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of a holes that could fit in a football field, and they were all filled with <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied to their back, and as they were looking for gold, <unk> in the waters <unk> with <unk>
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These were <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the world they were <unk> in their own <unk>
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells have up to 90 feet and these people carry heavy heavy bags that then will be transported to another area where the stone <unk> could extract the gold.
At the first view, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if you look closer to the margin we see working at other less fortunate and children.
All of these are victims of tissues, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely to be this <unk> victim as this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When he died his father his uncle took him to work with him on mines.
When they die his uncle, <unk> <unk> the uncle from the uncle who force it to be slave in mines.
When I met her, I had worked in the mines 14 years and the leg injury you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis and yet that, it's forced to work at night and day in that mine.
And yet, he would be released by being released and <unk> with the help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, to be able to be able to get a sense of a <unk>
I want to throw light on slavery.
Did you know that their pictures would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we're going to try testimony to them and we're going to make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see ourselves about other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not scientists -- these are people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I don't think about these so many beautiful people, <unk> that I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images will wake up a force in which you can see them in people like you, and I hope that force turn into a fire and that fire <unk> light about slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make applied mathematical math and there's a peculiar problem for the <unk> we are like the management material.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So I'm going to try to tell you what I do.
dance is one of the most human activities.
We would get rid of the <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  that we'll see later on.
But the ballet demand is a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of skill -- and probably some <unk> <unk> that can well be a genetic component,
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders as Parkinson's as Parkinson's -- gradually this extraordinary ability, like my friend <unk> <unk> which, in his time, was a <unk> <unk>
In the last few years there's a lot of progress in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way that we will know if there is really a cure -- if we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological markers -- so they don't have blood analysis and the best we have is a <unk> <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside of clinical trials are never done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the test for them.
It wouldn't be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is that I want to <unk> as a long way for a chance, you see, in some sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of vibration <unk>
It shows someone healthy while it emits sounds to talk to you, we can imagine as a dancers of a vocal stranger because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the genes necessary for example.
And as the seats requires an extraordinary training.
Think about time you take a child to learn how to talk about.
From the sound, we can track the position of vocal strings as <unk> and as Parkinson's disease affects <unk> also affects <unk> organs.
On the bottom plot you can see an example of <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
<unk> test is not <unk> they use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
They're both accurate. Okay, but in addition to their voice are not <unk>
I mean, you can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They are <unk> and we all know what happens is happening.
When something takes a huge cost of <unk> it appears to massive scale.
These are some amazing goals for <unk>
We can reduce the <unk> of the patients.
I wouldn't have to go to the clinic for the <unk>
We often could get a <unk>
We could make a massive <unk> cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when we give the first steps in that sense, we're launching the <unk> <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> or without Parkinson's disease, you can call it under price and I will leave recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached the percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   And Tom Rielly: So let's take all these samples of, let's say 10,000 people, you can say who is good and who is not?
What are you going to come from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease. TR: Sure.
<unk> You see, some people may not be <unk> you may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the factors of confusion in search of the real markers of the disease.
TR: You have a precision <unk> at this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
In fact, my graduate student, I have to <unk> has done a fantastic job and now has shown that it works on the mobile phone phone too, which is going to <unk> the project. We now have a 99 percent precision.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, he made <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are gray.
We were <unk> in the dark, in rooms without windows and usually we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models even more <unk> the perfect skin is still more than we do the impossible, we can be able to be able to get it possible and get them into the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste of the images and the photograph.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were going on Japan.
So shortly time later, an organization where it was <unk>  <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, next to hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay in home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13.
It's a little fishermen village located in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The water level we had reached over 24 feet of height and over three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the people were <unk>
<unk> rubble of channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the slime mold and leave the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of fish dead dead, <unk> <unk> of the local factory.
We were <unk> and loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like neighbors found things like this.
They found pictures and photographs of photos and cameras and cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places in the villages of around us to <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
While they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean up toilets <unk> huge <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And there was the <unk> and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and behold, I had heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I went to the same of my artistic who something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some of them who had over a hundred years -- some of them were still in the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I went on on Facebook, I contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to be <unk> with a lot of precision and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as having a picture of it.
Over the time of time, they came by luck more and more photos and they needed more <unk> so it went back again on Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people of 12 countries were offered to help.
When two weeks I had 150 people <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> to <unk> a village in northern <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the time we were working on the way that people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depends of course from the <unk> of the photos.
It could be an hour. I could have a couple of weeks.
It could be a few months old.
This <unk> had to draw pretty much by hand using the areas whose color and detail the water was not destroyed.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures that are used in the water, covered with bacteria with algae, and even by oil, all of it next to the time -- I continue to be able to <unk> it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless it was clean clean and dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm the photos of the <unk>
As once once once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures were lucky in relation to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> her but she stopped to realize that they were even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of his husband and his own face would not have been able to <unk> the images in a single picture and <unk> the full picture.
When I picked up their photos shared some of their story with us.
A few colleagues in her husband found the photos in a fire station between the rubble -- pretty far from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues would get it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Your little children, not so small now, but their two children were in school in different schools.
One of them was caught in the water.
He took her one week to find all his family and know that they were all gone.
The day I gave her her pictures his child was less than 14 years.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that he could do -- something that he could go back to look, something that I could remember from the past of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up there -- hundreds of them helped us clean on more than <unk> photographs -- the great majority of them, the great majority of them became the hands of their <unk> <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring up to 90 families -- hundreds of photos of totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we really don't spend more than a thousand dollars in teams and materials, most of the ink for <unk>
We take photos all the time.
A picture is a memory of somebody or something, one place, a relationship, somebody else.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing that we would give us but the first thing that we would look for.
This is what the project was trying to restore small pieces of humanity, to bring someone out of their connection to the past.
When a picture like this comes to somebody, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that you're in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of the <unk>
Some of them connected to something larger, would bring something, using their talent to something that are not thin skin models of perfect skin.
To finish me I'd like to read this email. I sent it down the day I came back from Japan after six months.
While <unk> couldn't avoid thinking about people and the stories are shown in the images.
One particular in particular, a picture with women from different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, <unk> me because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, my mother, and my mother just <unk> hangs out of our wall.
In the entire world, in all the few of our basic needs are the themselves, right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> were inspired by awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet walking through an apple in an exhibition in an exhibition of just one billionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion frames per second.
I give you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technical technique that can create videos on the slow camera of light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-ray and they defy really the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I went on and <unk> in a <unk> second, in a number of <unk> to create a photons package of just a millimeter size.
And that <unk> package that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common <unk>
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do those photons look like.
What's the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all this --    Remember that all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola didn't take this research --  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with a photons package that starts to <unk> and that, inside, starts to <unk>
Part of the light is going to go on the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons are finally coming to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's an air bubble that switches inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel over the table, and because of the top of the top of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that <unk> <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and current and we make it go down the same distance and see it in slow camera to about 10 billion times, how much people think that would take us to see that film?
One day? A week?
It would be a very boring film,  of a bullet <unk>
And what about testing with <unk> nature.
You can see the waves that would be <unk> from the table and the tomato wall.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond.
It is the way that nature paints a picture, and I thought of a <unk> at the same time, but of course, our eyes can see a raw composition of it.
But if you look at once a more time you look at it, you'll realize that, as the light comes from tomato <unk> it still <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces into its inside and then it turns out after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phone, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
So what do we create this camera in slums.
As well, you know, if you take a picture at the bottom of the exhibition, it goes very little light down.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the most short, so I just will go into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons million times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in crude and <unk>
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible,
And if a new power of the future <unk> would allow you to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door -- <unk> to go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera, to the camera, to the camera.
So where we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works how fast our <unk> has unique.
It has very good time resolution and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also the hidden objects but we don't know what point that corresponds to how a distance.
When you project a laser you can record a picture on <unk> that you see on the screen, it doesn't really have any sense.
But let's take a lot of images like this, tens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try to look at the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
We can see it <unk>
This is our dynamic.
We have things to explore before we pull this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are going to make a lot of <unk>
Or we could find survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at light reflected by open windows in the open windows.
Or we could build them <unk> able to see the inside of the body -- <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood is pretty difficult, so this is actually a asked for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new visualization of visualization to solve the problems of systems in the next generation.
So as a <unk> <unk> he became the science in art, an art of photographs of photographs of <unk>
And I realized that all the <unk> data we collect every time is not just for scientific respect, but we can see that we can be able to do scientific purposes.
And to create a new form of computer photography with a slow camera and color code.
And look at those <unk> Remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here's something fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going down from us.
The waves should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out that, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strangers. Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order for the events in the world to sometimes get invested in the camera.
<unk> the corresponding <unk> of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> your life, and gives you freedom out.
With a mobile phone, you can get a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, and you go back to <unk> and make it famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to look for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that they were looking for a change, had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who from the <unk> have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone.
<unk> <unk>
It's a lot. Almost everybody has a cell phone.
But I'm talking about my mobile phone, and how I changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> lines of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the Commission of the E.U. presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This uses that every single telephone company, every single Internet provider in all Europe, has to store a broad range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to me.
Who sends a text to me.
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in his phone company or their phone provider on the Internet.
And throughout Europe people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone and the Internet Internet <unk> all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, journalists, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who went out to the streets of Berlin and said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be <unk>
The <unk> was the secret police of East Germany, <unk>
And I also asked me if this really works.
You can store all this information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> <unk> who was the largest telephone company in Germany, and please take me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to ask them, and I didn't have a concrete response. It was all right.
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
And so I decided to make it <unk> because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end of the end of it.
<unk> the demand and they would send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Khmer Rouge <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing about brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> <unk> <unk>
At first I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge archive right.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I go at night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this <unk> information.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the <unk> <unk> means.
So next to <unk> <unk> and transforms it into City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and you can go back and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I go from <unk> on <unk> and what I often call in the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a bit of fear.
But it's not just me.
But from all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we talk a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call them between them.
And then you call the other, and the other one to the other, and we end up with this big network of communication.
You can see how your people communicate with each other what time they call each other, what time you go in.
You can see all this stuff.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what society.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who is talking to who, who gives you an email to who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a cell phone in the pocket.
And the <unk> would have known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this never had happened.
The fall of the Berlin Berlin may never have happened.
And as a result, not every single <unk> of <unk>
Because today, the state agencies and companies want to store as much information of us as possible inside and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility of keeping our lives and they want to <unk> forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go back home to your friends that privacy is a century of the 21st century -- and it's not done yet.
When you go home, you get to their representative that just because business agencies are able to store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what do you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that you can tell you to fight for the <unk> in the digital age.
Thank you.
Hello, <unk> What happens?
It's not enough.
Hello, <unk> What happens?
I call me <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.

A lot of people with brain paralysis not <unk> but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three older sisters were going to the public school, my parents went to the school system, and they would get rid of the school system, and if we didn't take all the ultimate note all the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk to the five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another phenomenon that I used was to hang on a dollar in front of me to get it up.
The <unk> I wear in it was very strong and <unk>
Yes. The first day in the boy was walking like a <unk> <unk> who has received a lot of these.
By growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Muslims and keep all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as a campaign.
People who grew up had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be <unk> a lot of hunger during the <unk>
I was telling them that he had enough fat to live three months without eat, so we <unk> from the dawn to sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Yes, in <unk> it's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to the school of dance.
I learned to dance with <unk> or I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I was too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I didn't go.
I was going on my uncle in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we were not going to be able to get Palestine all the <unk> all the <unk> <unk>
On the summer summer of summer often my father tried to be <unk> so I would drink milk from <unk> and put me warm milk on his back, and I was <unk> on the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the cure -- it was India.
I must say it's very boring, but before you do yoga it was a <unk> <unk> that I couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can put it in the head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be in the <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a scholarship for the <unk> University of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> <unk> of the theater.
Everybody <unk>
I made all the tasks of the least smart, I took the top note in my own, and also in their class.
Every time he made a scene from the glass of glass my teachers <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
And finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called a very slow <unk>
It's a work of a girl with brain <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started shouting at the four <unk> <unk> <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
By the end of the end of <unk>
Thank God <unk> in order to be <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  And they gave it to <unk>
I went to <unk> and I went to the director of the theater, I crying in historically, as if somebody had killed my cat, to ask why and she told me that because they believed it couldn't do the <unk>
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the <unk> you can't do the <unk>
It was a role for the one that was literally born and they gave it to a rock <unk>
The university was <unk> my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors with no disability <unk>
As I went back home, and my first <unk> <unk> was like extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew that it would be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Instead, he stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the directors of paper is not going to make <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's just <unk> to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
That's why I did <unk>
In my first tour, he took a famous book in New York City to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first breakthrough he took when he fell at the top of the New Jersey <unk> with a country that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, no censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that small rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find ourselves very fun.
In 2003, my brother to another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the Festival of the <unk> <unk> of New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and at the time remind you to fashion directors that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news news program, with Keith <unk>
I went to a graduate dance, I went to a study and sat in a <unk>
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I took up to the desk of <unk> to not come out of the screen during the <unk> and when the interview, was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they would not go back to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was kind of <unk> and I took my chair.
Something that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It tells you that kids are <unk> but they never fall away from me not a little bit of <unk>
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
I would give you clips on the line with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk> <unk> terrorist <unk>
What does it have?
We should really pray for it.
A person suggested to even I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't make <unk> then <unk> can't make someone in a wheelchair
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying not to <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, we have grown with the media media, I don't think <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need all the society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I got to act in a movie with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world, <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded "The children of <unk> a charity to give the children refugees Palestinians -- a little bit of what my parents were going to do.
It was the only time my father saw me living live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call me <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a young young people.
I don't know their name, but I know their story.
She lives in a small village to the South <unk>
This village is about <unk>
<unk> drives the little people to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without him there, it's going to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, there are no work, no <unk>
He ended up living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day he gets about a gentleman who offers him to <unk> after dinner, to <unk>
She meets a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
It gets a little bit of money so you bought new clothes to send money to their family.
They show a young guy.
They finally go home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky <unk> a bomb.
That little boy of that small village with the dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist and that dynamic group of people were at the <unk> a terrorist organization with al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a child of a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him <unk>
He was waiting for.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start their future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that he pulled it out of what we call "the <unk>
And their story is repeat in urban centers around the world.
This is the story of the <unk> young urban urban <unk> which was riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, which are looking at something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of city is the opportunity for jobs, but the young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people who live in cities will be under under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities, the story of the <unk> <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to violence -- to be the history of cities.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They don't really do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit <unk> Hospital.
I remember going to be in that hospital to <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I never had gone?
And if I had seen me forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
It would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually in order to spend some young leaders in a <unk>
<unk> to about 90 Chinese leaders <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, and no opportunity.
I remember when he told me when he told me, because I was a college university university -- I was frustrated, I was the perfect white guy for <unk> and other terrorist organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to reach out to the point B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed the traffic system and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and the <unk>
It started a <unk> company.
It began to be thrown into local residents who normally couldn't afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some time expand to hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story different?
I think your ability to identify and take a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think that business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so long.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who went to one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people in the height of business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of <unk>
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in more than 22 years ago, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic sent from abroad.
If you get to somebody, "When was the last time you saw <unk> flowers in it.
For those of you who grew up in civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and started growing <unk> and <unk> that he said, could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers to prove gardens by creating gardens in the homes, and the companies in the city, and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There's no public parks in <unk>
You want to create a space where the families, the young families, can go together, and like he says, smell are the <unk>
By the way, he's not growing pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
They forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So inspire young people and creating a culture of business spirit is really a great step, but young people need to make their ideas happen.
They need experience and orientation for <unk> in development and put out of their business.
They would take the young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support they need to move from conception to creation, and create <unk> for the urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed isn't just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Park -- that's how it's called, when it's created, when it is created, how people see their city.
<unk> hired kids on the street to help rent and keep the <unk>
They gave them the opportunity to escape from the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, to turn the young people in entrepreneurs, and they will eat their <unk> innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and the <unk> of the Peace that <unk> and <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> an area in northern New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun would make the leaves <unk> as a <unk> and not to be the way that we can find out we could almost pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a <unk> in a <unk> with a beautiful lake lake when I discovered something awful.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square feet with the apple hearts -- <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And he was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
<unk> who were too lazy as to pull out what they thought was going to clean his <unk>
That question went on with me, and it was <unk>
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how to <unk> or where the <unk> of our trash are in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> is about 11 tons of waste and <unk> tons of products -- every day.
I wanted to meet you as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I walked through his routes and interviewed people in offices and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get more.
So I began to work like <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I was the <unk>
And <unk> <unk> and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as <unk> as you believe -- and in the days that it's very strong you will become very quickly.
It costs a lot of <unk>
I met people who had been working on that for several years, and their bodies were still <unk> the weight of taking over their body -- tons of garbage every weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Office of <unk> <unk> the waste of waste is one of the ten most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming up and moving into traffic all day and they fly around you.
They just want to be <unk> so generally the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall from the truck and cause terrible damage.
And I also learned about the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the trash is like a force of nature itself.
It never stop coming.
It's also like a way of breathing or circulation.
It must always be in motion.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe strongly that <unk> are the most important work on the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first breast health <unk>
If you don't get rid of the waste in the efficient and effective shape every day, this starts to get rid of their <unk> and their dangers inherent in very real ways.
Except that we had controlled for decades and centuries come back to come and start to <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old one, we don't have space for the way that the economy of economics start to fail when it's in danger as well.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just remember his relationship.
And then it's what I call our average average speed necessary.
And I mean just at the speed of what they used to get used to be able to get used at the time.
We don't usually have <unk> or <unk> or we took us our cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there is a work force on the other side that will take out of it.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the collection of waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable city and human.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know when <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
It's almost a form of relief.
The flow that keep us apart from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow always has to stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11 of 2001, I heard the <unk> of a <unk> truck on the street, grabbed my little son, and I got the stairs running up and there was a man doing his journey of paper paper as I did it all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and said, "Let's be fine.
We're going to be good."
Shortly after that I started looking at the collection of waste and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we worked together a lot of times and we made some good friends.
I want to believe it was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts by <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we need to include and have to realize all the costs, even the very real human cost of the labor hand.
The city waste is what we think about when we talk about garbage -- they represent three percent of the waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next ones to see someone whose job is to clean up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work focuses on the connection of thinking about our community life, forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from the conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects today like this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a business center of a number of stories in the capital of Ethiopia, involving <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us as example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
And after seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large shops where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to spend a lot of energy because the skin of <unk> it gets heat into the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it is about a ocean climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees throughout the year.
And thirdly, what is nothing to do with Africa or with Ethiopia.
It's a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, it was actually dominated by the old market that is this structure in the open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a building, of several stories by applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the <unk> the site, which is located in a far of a lot of city growth in the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, bringing all the entries in the building.
And this spreads with a <unk> <unk> which creates a space to the free air in the building that would be held by its own shape, and the rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small business, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that we would get to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar fabric of a concrete concrete <unk> to allow the air, and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
We then inspire us in these beautiful buttons in the dresses of the <unk>
They have the properties of the fractal geometry and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that they leave the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little crystals of colors that use the light inside the building to light the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't really easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a shopping center that was not what you want.
But ultimately, we all realized that this idea of the market would be much more profitable than the commercial center because at the end of accounts there were more local to sell this?
And also the idea of the facade was a lot more economic -- not just because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it was no longer necessary to have air.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the power of energy for the building in a city where electricity is cut up almost every day.
So we get a huge advantage putting on the roof.
And then under those panels we think of the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this resource.
And these <unk> on the roof, which are set up and collect water for the inside.
It's waiting for the beginning of the next year, because we're going on the fifth floor of the construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a big project, the biggest thing that I have designed with, I needed not just to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention in the <unk> a structure of a thousand years of ancient <unk> that was surrounded by a wall with dozen connected doors for lines almost straight.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was to extend the streets of existing streets by creating 12 initial blocks similar to size and characteristics that are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select a few different points in relation to the idea of the doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the small cell in the project, like the apartment, as a essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural nature.
So <unk> a framework that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections for the communities.
And it also responds to the local rules that they set up more density in higher levels and lower density in the low plant.
And it also <unk> this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite favorite space of the project is almost like giving up the community around the construction community.
It's where all the neighbors, they can climb and <unk> and do such as a race of two miles in the morning, or jump from one building to the other.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in life of people change the communities and local economies at the same rate as the buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and they have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable as you see all the new girls.
It had great amounts of bright hair and a little <unk> of <unk> cute. It was very strong for the middle of the states, very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year and I was full of Records" until I <unk> my <unk> plan.
One day I got a time after the middle of the school was a little bit, and I hid in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took the table of my teacher in the book of grades.
And then I did.
<unk> my <unk> <unk> just a little bit, just a few of you.
All of me --  And I was invited to bring up the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of the rows of <unk> and myself a row in a row -- just because of being there, because I was <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good about it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk> me.
It's that everything was <unk> obvious <unk>
I never <unk>
But most of all, I was telling me the reason why I was bothered to me, that this little little girl was so good for <unk>
I was <unk>
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies are suffering from jealousy.
Also, the primates. <unk> are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause one of the U.S. murder in the U.S.
And yet, I have never seen a study that <unk> or the longest duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the lab in which we are studying <unk> in all of their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it is a exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> <unk> there would be no literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
Wouldn't it have it?
<unk> the reading lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> wouldn't have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
There is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers to everything, and as soon as you have all of them.
This year is 100 years of his work <unk> "In a search for time -- the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also <unk> <unk> all we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think in a <unk> <unk> in your <unk>
We forget how hard that image.
We forgot about how diverse it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know how the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
So let's see why they're so good together, the novel and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the others that reduce the person, to their wish, to their <unk> are a good narrative basis <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel earlier, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel wrong.
Being at the time -- and I audience, we know exactly what details <unk> to <unk> the <unk> right?
The <unk> make us all <unk> and that's something that <unk> understand.
All that she does to give us pleasure could give pleasure to another, maybe right now.
And it starts to tell himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every nice <unk> thing that <unk> it detects in his own, it adds it to its collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You need to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break with him.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the great amounts of bright hair and the cute little <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> from the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links to the language <unk> with the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his hometown of soon listening to the doors of the doors and <unk> to the <unk> of his own, then it requires those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's all scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> you see <unk> and make us seem like <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge, search for the truth, a real painful. In fact, what to <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth, better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> these were the way to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs us to do, that makes us feel caused by us a much more profound range of more profound feelings than a wise man who can be <unk>
It is telling us that we're going to look for women.
No, I think it's trying to say that the <unk> will reveal ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
There is some other emotion to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young man who was being consumed with the idea that his woman was doing it.
And Freud says that there was something strange about that man, which was not <unk> in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspected without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, without realizing that <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or made it accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> describe very well how <unk> are going to look at the intensity but without precision.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent or illegal <unk>
<unk> leads us to behave in totally <unk>
Now I'm thinking about the age of eight years, I mean, I'm also thinking about this story I heard on the news.
A woman of Michigan of 52 years old was captured by having created a false account in Facebook from the one that was sent messages horrible to itself, for a year.
For one year, every year.
She was trying to join the new girlfriend of his former <unk> <unk> I have to tell you, when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How huge -- although <unk> creativity.
It's like <unk>
Like a novel of Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She is a very strange character and brilliant of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that are trying about how the others to do that as opposed to our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a moment.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to get out of your own being and <unk> out of what ever <unk> and it's under the floor.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all over the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
That is, we're good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when you're in a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> at Professor <unk> that criminal genius of it.
But I've always heard <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but it bothers him.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but it was <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of the mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once he <unk> <unk> <unk> to all of his solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And it tells you that there is no person in <unk> <unk> that I wouldn't want to take your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> in history. It looks like this very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat the <unk> like a geometry, without excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> is the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you're on the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> allows you to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so beautiful.
What happens if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to this?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the excellence of the other.
We can do it with it.
But I like the <unk> plans.
So as we hope that happens, we remember that we have fiction for <unk>
Only fiction is <unk>
<unk> used to <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> sweet sweet <unk> the scary Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the very, crazy <unk>
We're at great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21 of us in 1969, Edmund <unk> jumped out of the module <unk> of Apollo 11 and went on the Sea, <unk>
Armstrong and wondered they were alone, but their presence in gray surface is the implementation.
The Apollo program was the largest income of peace in the U.S. story.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars in today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave a few 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They killed people, including <unk>
But before the Apollo Apollo program <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on the surface, of which we were going on, after death death last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't have a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds.
Why do we <unk> The CRISPR response is that they were because the president Kennedy wanted to show the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the <unk> words at the University of Rice in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask, why do we <unk>
Why do it turn it into our goal?
And they could also ask, why scale the mountain more <unk>
35 years ago, why would they fly on the <unk>
Why does it play Rice against <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the Moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> <unk> was not just a complete victory of the West on the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the significance of the powers of technology.
They were because it was a great thing to do that.
The landing on the Moon came up in a context of a long list of evolution.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, curiosity.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and looked at smallpox.
The technology seemed to own what decides <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse or a horse with candle -- but in 1969, the <unk> of Apollo 10 flew to 40,000 miles /
From 1970, no human being has become the moon.
No one has traveled faster than <unk> of Apollo 10, and the optimism of optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that problems that we imagine that technology would be would solve a clean energy, to create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the world population seem to be <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't get to a <unk> tube of the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission but I was completely sure that I would see the colonies on Mars.
So that happens, it occurred to our capacity to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard that all the time.
We've heard this for the two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists would have been <unk> and they had fun with conceptual toys -- things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and our lives.
But we don't understand the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have been created less ambitious companies than <unk> of the years in which we were going to be <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, in concrete, the incentives that venture capitalists offer to the entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused the creation of ideas that are <unk> by the funding of problems -- or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong with <unk> Valley.
Even when the risk of risk were at their high point without worrying about risk, they have small investments that could come out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble to invest with the benefit of technologies as energy, which need a huge capital and whose development is long term.
No, the reasons why we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you were <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We won't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the big problems because the political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the global energy consumption comes from sources of energy energy as solar and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely economic now.
The coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want energy sources of alternatives that can compete in price.
Now, physicists and entrepreneurs are according to what policies and international support development -- development of <unk> energy -- a significant increase in research and energy development, and some kind of control of the coal.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we're going to see an energy policy of America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seem to happen, does not be.
We know from the time that have been a result of failure of failure to move food.
But 30 years of research have taught us that humans are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for the storage and model of food, but there will be whether there was bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president is saying to the cancer of cancer in Paris, but soon we found that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant to treatment, and only over the last 10 years seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and we can do it, but these four elements have to be <unk> The political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem: institutions have to support the <unk> it must be really about a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the capacity of technology to solve big problems, it does with those bill.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> how hard and dangerous, and there's no popular mythology of science fiction as the way of exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, it wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start <unk> the <unk> ideas that you have about trust.
They're so common that has become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a great decline in trust, it's a very general belief, of it.
The second one is <unk> we should have more trust.
And the third one is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a deeper idea about the issue.
First of the <unk> why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I will turn on to think that it may have dropped in some activities or institutions or institutions that could have gone up in others.
I don't have clear.
But I can look at the surveys of opinion, and these surveys are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has <unk>
When you look at the opinion surveys over time, there's no many evidence of it.
I mean, the people who were <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, they keep <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they continue to be pretty <unk> in the same other nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half the way.
But it is this evidence that is enough?
What the surveys of <unk> are, of course, opinions.
What else can you say?
What you look at is the <unk> attitudes that people think when they ask certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
And you probably want to ask for asking, "What do you do?
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some other not."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to build trust in a <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel for a certain type of <unk> or a person -- it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say I trust a certain primary school teacher I know to give the reading class -- but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we let all of that knowledge when we think of trust in a more <unk> way.
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they try to make it <unk> the good inherent judgment in fact of trust something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
I think it's a goal stupid.
This is not that goal that I would get in.
I would have to have more confidence in what it's <unk> but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I'm <unk> of not to trust what it's not <unk>
And I think that those people who have <unk> their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say it, he says, yeah, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
So it's about doing a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if you find that one person is <unk> on <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worth of trust.
But if, on the other hand, they're not wrong, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends that are <unk> and honest, but they didn't get to get a letter to the mail -- because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they would take their own <unk>
And I'm very happy to say I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible for but extremely <unk>
If this is like this, I haven't yet <unk>
But that's what we're going to do is that we are going to move forward before we trust.
The trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we have to <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've been trying to build <unk> systems for all sorts of institutions, professional professionals, officials and others, that made us easier for the task to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see the problem is that it takes more time to make the actual <unk> <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and <unk> the system of accountability is destined to ensure the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> actually is making the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> as we say.
I must have all of you all know the similar examples.
It would take all of that, for the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if you were to be worthy of trust and <unk> the people that are reliable and if other people are reliable if other people or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions -- what you don't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> to the task rebuild the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, ultimately, is defining because they provide us other people.
You can't rebuild what other people have given you.
You have to give them the <unk> so you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, it's because you can't <unk> by all people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to be able to make sure that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That is every day, everywhere, it makes the common people, the <unk> institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a single commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says I can <unk> without giving care of us.
I wear it and get my money, or they get the money out of the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson on that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So in the end, I think what we're pointing at is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that frame, you can determine when and how the other person is worth of trust.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we have come up with <unk> to reduce the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone increasingly and more and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one another, the glass of a <unk> screen and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if there was no <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
First of them created this tool that goes into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen takes their physical body to the bottom.
The designers can bring up their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool they break the barriers.
But the two hands remain out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole skill of hands?
In the division of Science Sciences of Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
We would have a transparent bombsight with the cameras of depth to detect your fingers and the face, you can now raise the hands of the keyboard, to get inside of 3D space, and grab pixels directly with hands.
Like the windows and the files have a location in real space, <unk> is as easy as grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and point lines or words with the virtual <unk> sensor that are down from every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with hands.
So in these examples, we are <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come to us?
<unk> many of us will have bought and returned things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk>
This is the vision that you get from a device in your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea more far, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them be physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would it be a future.
At the Media Lab at MIT with my tutor Hiroshi Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> when, we create this only <unk>
This magnet, <unk> behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that the computer as the users can move the object anywhere in this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of cell, and we get <unk> and <unk>
And when we program the object, the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and get to reproduce and they are always in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and physically and a famous distance from Michael Jordan, can reproduce as a physical reality of the times that we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and, unlike the computers, or the books of text, this is an actual experience that you can play and feel.
But what is more fascinating to change the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show us something but begin to act directly on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without us to <unk> our world.
We started the talk today about talking about a barrier, but if you get that barrier, the only limit that is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the years.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to take a school for athletes with all expenses <unk>
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, as them.
After surviving the Industrial Revolution, they create firmly that there was only a critical path to <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter if the work I'd like or not.
But my dream was to be an opera singer for me.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could go to the opera school.
I until I wrote to the director of the school and the <unk> of a radio program.
But no adult will give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Just my friends <unk> me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at age 15, I knew it was too much more to train.
My dream never <unk>
I think for the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was as unfair.
So I solved another <unk>
No one around me wanted to be <unk> OK.
We went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> I got to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that I read here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese <unk>
And it's not propaganda for <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a theme for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> and to put my relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also gave me to my reading <unk>
<unk> lots of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning of this map I thought it was out of place because this is what students in China learn.
He had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are all the research fields like pure religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> gives academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if you read comparative reading for research, why not do it in life <unk>
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from David <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> Zero fear and <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> Alan <unk> instead of losing in the translation, I found that you can make a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that in Chinese <unk> literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
The books opened me a magic door to fight with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel like I could be able to feel like that.
Having a <unk> dream is really nothing compared to what many people have <unk>
I've come to believe that disgust is not the only purpose of a dream.
His most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, come from where the passion comes from.
Even a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of books, that I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client of <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinic in Berkeley.
She was a woman in 26 years called <unk>
Alex came to the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> stood on the couch of my office and took up the shoes and told me that I wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I was a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories <unk> that Alex brought to the <unk> and made me easy to move the head while they get the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he said, Belgium -- she was right.
You start to work after that, you have children later, it has kids later, to death later.
It was to ask myself as a Alex and I had <unk>
But shortly after, my <unk> <unk> to press Alex that I talk about their <unk> life.
I was <unk>
I said, "Yes, it's coming up with guys under their category <unk> with a head <unk> but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> he said, "It's still not no, but maybe you get to the next one.
Also, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before they <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they were <unk> but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex <unk>
This was made of Alex <unk> the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And so I realized that this kind of toxin was a real problem and had real consequences -- not just for Alex and their loving life, but for the careers, families and future <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think nobody comes to the age without spending before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you remove the dream of a <unk> I want to see. It's okay.
This is not just my opinion. This is the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to the 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments that give you a way to your life will have happened to when they have 30 and <unk>
People from over 40, not <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we would have.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or are coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up their second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something that wants to change themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that the female fertility comes to their top to the 28 and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment to <unk> about their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which their everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who was <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in human development.
But this is not what they're listening.
The newspapers talk about changes on the line of the <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Your <unk> said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
It doesn't happen.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and not absolutely anything.
And then every single day, it intelligent, interesting as you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship is not true. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that as a race before 30, everything will be good."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are by <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
He had better copy the day I graduated from the <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some time around 30, they broke the music and they all began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who was going stop, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little end -- but it doesn't look at the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there is a huge pressure to the <unk> and so many of us started a career, choose a city, choosing a couple, and having two or three children in a long time period.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that start to show you, which is much more difficult and systematic to do everything in the <unk>
<unk> middle-aged crisis is not about buying red cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career you want now.
<unk> you realize you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was I doing?
I want to change what they're doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it could be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
In the 25, Emma came to my office because I was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said I'd like to work in art or in the entertainment, but I still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working like <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And in spite of living a few very difficult, their previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then they got up to the same time, "You don't pick his family, but you can choose their friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost every hour.
I just had to buy a new stage for <unk> and it had gone all the morning in the morning and he had a lot of these, but then he was seeing the empty space that goes after the words <unk> -- please call <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw me and he said, "Who will be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of whether it gives me <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the decade <unk> in Emma went forward.
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First, I said to Emma who was <unk> from that identity crisis and <unk> capital of identity.
For identity capital, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is a investment in what they want to be after.
I didn't know the future of <unk> career and no one knows the future of work, but I know this: capital capital creates an identity.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, of that company that you want to prove it.
I'm not <unk> exploration of <unk> I am <unk> the exploration that shouldn't count, that by the way, it's not exploration,
It's <unk>
I said to Emma who would explore jobs and make them tell.
Second, I said to Emma who urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you at the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds are limited to who you know what you know about how you think about how they do talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who has to get out of it is almost always coming out of its <unk>
The new things come from what they're called <unk> friends of friends from their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half no, and the weak ties are the shape of <unk> to this group.
Half of the <unk> jobs would never be <unk> then, to meet the head of your neighbor is the way we get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose their family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma would soon give her family to her family, when she has a couple and his own family.
I told Emma that time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit at head than 20 or even 25 and even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live right now or let you get into Facebook now when everyone on Facebook start to walk into the <unk> not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you do it, and that involves being as harmful in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just to do it work or kill time with anyone who will be <unk>
So what happened with <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found a quarter of a prime who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped him get a job there.
That work of work gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend with which I live.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married with a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves his new family, and I send me a letter to say, "Now the spaces of contacts services are not enough.
The story of Emma can sound easy, but that's what I love working with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like planes that come out of the airport of Los Angeles, which come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fits in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at the same way, to the age of 25 or 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth of spread all the <unk>
It's as simple as I learned to say to <unk>
It's what I now have the privilege to say to <unk> as Emma every day, <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get capital capital of identity, using their weak ties to your family.
They don't stop defined by what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job in management management for a work that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to graduate students in public schools in New York schools.
And as any teacher, I took tests and tests.
I gave them tasks.
When the work was going to be <unk>
What struck me was that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance had no <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in math in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts aren't impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for time.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure the best way to measure better.
It's the <unk> but what happens if it's going to be success in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn in a quick way and that easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to university to become <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all sorts of <unk> <unk> and every study of my question was, who is success here and why?
My research team and I went to the Academy of <unk> West <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who <unk>
We went to the <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what children are going to do as far as possible in competition.
We studied <unk> teachers working in really difficult neighborhoods -- what teachers are still teaching for the end of the year of school and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the outcomes of learning from their <unk>
We teamed up with private companies, asking you, what of these marketers are going to keep their <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts it came up with a feature as a important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and it wasn't <unk>
It was the <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to reach very long term.
<unk> is to have resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not just for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is living life as if it was a <unk> not a race at all speed.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my negotiating determination and then waited for more than a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly greater likely to <unk> even when the <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of testing tests even the safety that they felt the children when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the <unk> National <unk> where the <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, how little science knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How development the determination in children?
What should I do to teach kids a great ethic of work?
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals who simply don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination is often not related to it or is even related to the measurements of talent.
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about developing determination is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not <unk> that can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and they learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to the challenge, are much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mentality is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger, and we need <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start to start all over the way together.
In other words, we need to be certain about making our kids more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty, and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that time, I was inspired by this incredible language.
But it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break up this <unk> so that I want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language I can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method of learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic academic <unk> 20 thousand characters.
You just need a thousand to understand the basic literacy
The first 200 will allow 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read the signs of traffic <unk> <unk> to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers.
Today I'll start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as it can be possible until it's <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a walk.
<unk>
If the way of the fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if it was shouting in a <unk> way, <unk> I'm <unk> this symbol is actually <unk> the way it calls -- but I like to believe it is in the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors of a <unk> in the old West.
I call this eight characters.
They are building blocks so that they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are a company, three are a crowd.
If one person stretches your arms, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> to remember, a single tree is pretty idiot.
Remember the <unk>
Two together, it's very hot.
Three together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and one night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door. Put a table inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is coming hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, it's <unk>
So we've already spent for almost 30 characters.
By using this approach, the first eight radical eight will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters build other 32.
So with every small effort, they will be able to learn a couple hundred characters -- which is the same thing that you learn an Chinese Chinese Chinese.
So after I met the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know Japan is the land of the Sun <unk>
This is a sun placed with the first one, because Japan is in this China.
So a sun next to us, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two stacked mountains over the other.
In the old China, that meant in tofu because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the <unk> has become out.
A mouth that tells you where you go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind you that I should stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The movie <unk> his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a bright dress and take a magic group.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
Now we live and we bring our children into a kind of industrial <unk>
However, the magician of Oz was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend actually took rise to 40 years later on, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal guy and a <unk> boy would take a girl inside the bottom of the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?  Yes.
There's a big difference between these two movies, there's a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence.
The monkeys are quite aggressive, like the <unk>
But I think if the magician was done today, the magician would be done today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the driver.
They would have magical shoes to defeat the rest of the evil <unk> computer.
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the magician of Oz is that the most wise characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did my daughter, <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son at the time.
Just three years.
It wasn't invited to projection because it was still very small to that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance had <unk>  So, he was fascinated in the room and he became impressed as a mother leg with his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk>
I wonder what <unk>
They would be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It would be the feeling that Luke is one of a army to protect the government?
<unk> this with the magician of Oz <unk>
So how does it win Dorothy his film?
We do good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up with this, OK?
Why are there that such as a lot of capital loan F, force in movies for our children, and so little of the way of <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of the films of male violence in the girls, and they should <unk> It's very good.
I have not read so much about how kids react to this.
I know by the experience that Princess <unk> doesn't provide the right framework that I had served to navigate through the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first role, I really expected the tax to come up because it's the end of the film, right?
My search has done, I have a girlfriend.
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are a lot of exceptions, and to defend <unk> from Disney to anybody of you.
But they send a message to kids, even though they kids, they are not really their goal.
They do a fantastic job when I teach girls how to defend the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all times is continuing on classic on classic after classic each of them on the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who raised a young girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out of it.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in shops.
Do you remember what the critical criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar, has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost no one of these movies <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It hasn't yet thrown roots and <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book and in the middle of the 1980s, I recorded a conversation that had had a friend about the assessment of movies you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> in the film, there is more than a female character than it has been.
So you have to get the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else than the kid than you like it?  All right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely I see it in the movie that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success of <unk> an idea of consensus about what a movie Hollywood movie is.
<unk> not the test of <unk>
And I don't think it was going to be <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the movie is happening in a embassy where men and women are hiding during the crisis of <unk>
We have lots of scenes of men who have deep conversations and painful in this <unk> and it's the great moment for one of the audience to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go into the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 movies more popular movies, how many of them believe they have actors -- <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's fine.
But there's a larger number that this is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, this is what he said, right?
In the United States, one in the United States, one of five women said that it's been sexually <unk> ever in his life.
I don't think it's a mass entertainment.
I don't think movies for kids have something to do with that.
I don't think that video videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What don't they get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very amazing statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools we have tools like <unk> <unk> and we hope that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their own <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly parents.
I think we have to show our male children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of the man is changing everything.
You have read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite favorite character was <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common <unk>
Maybe it's not just the bright dress in it.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want to be less stories in which I tell my <unk> <unk> and just more stories where their work looks like to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people improve and be better people, like the <unk>
Thank you.
As a kid, I was living in Maine and one of the things that I liked was to look for sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would be lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They are covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, with the time, I went to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I had my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of almost 1.3 miles away, along the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see another way.
I want to show you a example of how different we see the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern <unk> of Egypt called <unk>
And all of all, at simple view, it seems to be brown but when we use the infrared and we process it using the color color, suddenly the place looks like pink pink
What you're seeing are the real chemicals in the landscape of the landscape of building materials and the activities of the ancient economy?
I want to share with you how we have used satellite data to find a ancient <unk> city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the old Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place is located in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Ottoman Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere inside this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> by <unk> miles.
Back at the road. <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed the time, moved into this and covered the entire city.
So how to find a city in a <unk> landscape.
And I'm going to try and see that the random would be the equivalent of a needle in a <unk> with the <unk> eyes, and using baseball.
So we use NASA <unk> data.
We were able to see where the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly small area that you see inside the circle here, that we think could be the location of <unk>
So we are involved with the young Egyptians doing <unk> <unk> you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of the ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five feet down, under a thick thick layer -- we find a dense layer of objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a occupation of occupation of several hundred years that date from the Ottoman Ottoman exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> what shows that there was a <unk> workshop there.
This might seem that it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the <unk> of the Ottoman Empire -- these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that comes back in the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a elite elite workshop that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We haven't yet found <unk> here, but we would take place to the place in a close future.
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians at the use of satellite technology, so they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Ottoman Empire and probably been written in <unk> about 4,000 years ago.
So sharing knowledge is the most <unk>
There's nothing like that on the land.
So as I think, TED wasn't founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas actually actually started in 1984 and C.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, front of the door of <unk>
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that's made.
Now <unk> a group of <unk> obese <unk>
They are competing in a <unk> race and go in direction to his door <unk>
I need to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide against the door of his house.
There are bicycles flying all over the place, wheels that pass on its side, rays of the wheels that end up in places -- <unk> the threshold of the door, <unk>
<unk> in the lobby, or what's on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light. The light is shining about the <unk> of the <unk>
<unk> <unk>
On a brown horse on a brown horse.
It's a horse that I'm talking about.
You can feel your <unk> blue <unk> on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you can go on to get into the mouth.
You go on a side and go to your living room.
Because in the room, and making the maximum use of your imagination, you imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing on his <unk> <unk> singing <unk> A <unk> One <unk>
Now I went to the kitchen.
The ground has been covered with a yellow brick path and from the oven, come to you <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping up with you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk>
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist I guess, this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages and different habits of sanitation.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers <unk> only one time.
<unk> the names of dozens and tens of strangers.
I have whole poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who I could memorize the ultimate <unk> the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people have to be the phenomena of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Rouge who had come from England and has one of the best <unk>
I said, <unk> when you realize that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I am not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
We have been trained to do these <unk> <unk> acts using old techniques invented a half thousand years ago, in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their <unk> and that academics were used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was, <unk> How do I have no heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the room of the competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English and a little <unk> and he said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
Do you know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of <unk> live in national television.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me.
I mean, you have to start by something right?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work, and what it can be their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very well with the worst memory in the world.
Her memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows you to see how far our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk>
We went through a afternoon in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And when I come back, I read a lot of treated about the English memory, something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having a <unk> memory and <unk> and <unk> wasn't a very rare thing as it might look like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they have also changed.
We have changed the <unk> and I would say that they have changed the cognitive too.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes it looks like we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people who are passionate about this idea of <unk> memory and <unk> and <unk> is this competition as unique memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there are <unk> in the whole world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College from London invited a group of memory, the lab.
They wanted to know, will be that it has brains in some way, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're even smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them into a <unk> MRI machine -- you know, their brains while <unk> expensive faces, faces and forms of the snow. They found that in terms of memory <unk> <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually <unk> or they looked like <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There's something that we can learn from this?
The tournament of the competitive <unk> is running as an armed race where every year appears somebody with a new way to remember more things, faster and then the rest of the competitors have to get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times memory.
On his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of letters -- <unk> that he is about trying to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and just he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk> <unk>
In half an hour. Yeah.
And as there is a lot of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques used at the end of a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It is illustrates with a elegant paradox like the <unk> <unk> <unk> says the following: I say to two people who remember the same word. I say to you -- there is a man called <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> that there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them <unk> that word I told you a <unk>
<unk> which <unk>
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told to be told is <unk>
The same word, different capacity of <unk> that's weird.
What about here?
Well, your name doesn't really mean anything for you. It has no relationship to you.
With all the other memories they dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
It was very well when they come home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when you get that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some time after that.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this comes back a half thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> who went to a <unk>
They had been hired as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, they didn't have a <unk> <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up foot, <unk> his memory poem and <unk> and so soon it was, the room of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> everyone.
But not only killed all of us killed all of us, but it reminds the bodies of <unk> <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
So they wouldn't be able to <unk> the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
He was standing out of standing outside, only <unk> in the middle of the rubble, shut his eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where he had been sitting every single way.
I took the family out of the hand <unk> where their loved ones were in between the rubble.
What we were talking to you at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we're not good at remembering or phone numbers or instructions on the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial space.
If you ask them to tell me, the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> is very likely to do it.
But I would bet that if you asked them to tell you who I was sitting on the horse he was brown in his lobby, they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory of memory is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first <unk> memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you were invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it from the same way that he would have made it <unk> if they would have been invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine that they're on the door of your house.
And it came up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous <unk> and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing they want to mention is that competition completely <unk>
And then you can imagine them coming into your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk> <unk>
And that will remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote they want to tell.
And then they play in the kitchen, and the fourth theme that they wanted to be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
This is how the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- not word for word, which is going to confuse you a typical typical one.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
This is a breath of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first <unk> would be like the first place in his memory.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got stuck with that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something big about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is an boring.
But seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting at tests. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets <unk>
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things going on in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in their place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an old school <unk> in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was fun.
I would never have hoped that I would get it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just trying to train memory.
What it's actually about doing is to make more and more the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images, <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I felt pretty much with this.
This is me, using my standard <unk> for memory competition.
This is a couple of <unk> and some of the security signs covered with tape leaving only two <unk> because the diver is the worst enemy of an memory.
I ended up coming back to the same competition that I had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could put in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve good <unk> for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be able to memorize speeches and phone phone phone numbers -- but this is actually not the point.
So these are just a little bit of tricks.
Because they're based on pretty basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit of <unk> about how their mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift -- but it's not the case.
The great memories <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus on.
The palace of <unk> -- these memory techniques are just ready.
In fact, it's not even <unk>
They work because they do <unk>
It would take a kind of deep processing kind of processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of us are not <unk> out there.
But the reality is that there is no wonder.
This is how things do <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today, it's what the <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me that is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what our very short existence is in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks on our side -- we're going to be so <unk> that we don't even get into process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are amazing memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'll talk to you about the last 30 years of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex subject -- so it would take a place -- just a <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from <unk> -- I was six years old, and I lived there at home my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there they all spent the time when I was watching television -- so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, I all looked at me and every time I went to me, and I came back into a <unk> everyone would be seen.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> and it hated it.
So I was able to get that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
Right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, and not the division of areas, but of those connections that are emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that we <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel like that, because according to the Protection Agency and the Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
So 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you were thinking about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know you think about it as well as that in a building built a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we built our buildings.
It's a <unk> emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long time a long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build a museums of art.
And in the 20th century, in America, we use it to build homes.
Look, these were stable, stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is frightening.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> and governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the Public Public Library of <unk> which ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a <unk> and it has this round thing, and you have this round <unk> -- red, that they leave <unk> what it <unk> trying to communicate with this <unk> the children, the values of property, history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, was ended up another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and will be able to share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called <unk> are so completely different.
And the answer is that architecture works at the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> architects who constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for life forms of life today.
We were able to do it so much, that we get away from all of the people.
All of black, this is <unk> you think we feel very well, but we're dead because we don't have another choice.
We have to go on the other side and get to connect with those symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we started to experience <unk> we do <unk> on the back to go forward, over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.
Well, 30 years ago, <unk> from the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small <unk>
Something really hard.
So we are approaching the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
And then we put the way back into the other direction.
We take those ways that we know and <unk>
And we would call them <unk> and we added some of new materials.
They love it.
We don't give it <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we turned them into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The shapes <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
It's crazy.
But they were the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent the time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own fantasies <unk>
Those fantasies could be the <unk> to the French or the Italian
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy, because instead of creating new spaces, we use memories from other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects are frustrated and we started to make the way back in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started to experience with the <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now we have new design techniques of <unk> design techniques and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that are <unk> against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> you're totally <unk>
Normally the <unk> <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk>
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when and the public and public and public <unk> were completely aware of a building.
New York Times <unk> this building of <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao held in a thousand percent when the building.
So suddenly, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and he was everywhere.
He was our first architect star.
But how is it possible that these shapes wild and <unk> how it is possible to become ubiquitous in the whole world?
And it happened, because the media will spread around them and quickly learned that those shapes and services and innovation.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The same one made the world's main April of the world.
So they all believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and services.
This phenomenon in the beginning of the new development happened with another star.
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects in the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to go through the whole architecture.
Think about, for example, how they consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have walked up to the next people to see a building.
The transportation is <unk> you can take a boat, a plane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see on the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers from architecture, and the building is transported beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so quick, it moves up.
It's not very precise for thinking about a building.
It takes a long time to build a building, three or four years old, and in that time, an architect can design two or eight, or 100 buildings more, before I know if that designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a year of two years, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That is never going to happen. Because we're on the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel or the elevator or the vertical revolution and the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the means of communication, it starts to swing faster and faster, until to be in both extremes of <unk> and <unk> effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and the public.
We can now make symbols of <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly the product, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started to get and share it in the social media, the building stopped being just a building, it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, because these are not just images of a building, they are the images that one made of the building.
And as you use them to tell their story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and when you charge these roads, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell us each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first of the Internet to search for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> of innovation, what can a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell them that there is no answer to what it can be a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom of experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are no longer these mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and complicated, and one is no longer a <unk> public that doesn't embrace something that has never seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't stop <unk> by architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> of one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions right to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that buildings in the morning will be very different to the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick in the ideas of what it has to be <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the ways that they're going to produce.
That means that buildings would be <unk> to the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, it can also serve to make sports or for <unk> or even you can marry there at night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming on the East <unk> in New York, and raise half a million dollars of the community attached around that cause, it's no longer a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small to innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to look at.
Because no matter if it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we built is what we build.
The architects already know how to make buildings more <unk> smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not just reflect our society, but they shape to the most <unk> spaces, the local libraries of local libraries of households where we form our children, and the step of the bedroom the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just took a year and already started walking.
And it makes it a typical way of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves her mind.
<unk> and <unk> and it gives himself these big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And I think of all his friends doing this and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And he made me think, when couple of doing this?
How is it that we suddenly are not comfortable with our <unk>
Because apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for fine "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and she lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, it just wants to be dear and <unk>
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because even though his mom tells him all the time he is beautiful, every day in school, somebody tells him it's ugly.
And what his mom tells him and what his mom said to him, or friends from school they say, doesn't know who to believe.
So a video of it is, I put it on YouTube, and ask others to leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm a <unk>
Okay, so far, <unk> has gotten over 13 <unk>
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talked about a normal healthy teenager, and then you get these answers in one of the stages of their most vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, in their majority of teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what are you doing this?
Well, adolescents today almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, speaking, <unk> giving me <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected in a continuous way, <unk> so young.
As a mother said to me, "It's like a party in his room all <unk>
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that goes from hand with that is <unk>
This environment of being always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of people who have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There is no division between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what it is next?
What is the best thing in the life of someone in front of what is normal in a every day?
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news news now.
<unk> <unk> zero follow our <unk>
<unk> technique is now a routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of the <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture.
It's not hard to see what young people.
But kids are not immune to this.
It's like the superheroes of the sports, and the singers in the <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we surely want our kids to grow healthy and make individuals well <unk>
But in a culture I'm obsessed with the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, at the price of all the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities and their studies and other aspects are starting to kill them.
Six of every 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and how they organize society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the classroom.
One of each five are not coming to classes during the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the test season, if you don't think you see you enough, well, specifically if you don't think you're smart enough -- you know, one note less than the average of your fellow people who don't care about that of how you think about it.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland and China, and China.
And it gives rise to what these young people.
So to be very clear, of course, we are talking about how you look at you, not what you're really like.
<unk> on its body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk>
<unk> with little self-esteem are making less physical activity, and they eat less fruits and vegetables, engage in more diet not healthy that you can take them to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people surrounding them and are at more risk of depression.
And we think that's all about this for what they make more <unk> decisions like the consumption of alcohol and drugs, diet -- surgery -- surgery to ages of the early ages and without protection and damage damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing into the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they have overweight again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
Eighty percent of women don't present to an interview interview in a day where they don't feel safe with the way you see it.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be?
<unk> this potential is of interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, by itself, it doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways -- the first one is that we have to trust your own body.
We have to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
And I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of good <unk> programs -- without realizing it <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children are not just going to have a positive impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are crucial starting points for anybody willing to provide an education in body self-esteem to work.
A education is fundamental -- but to deal with this problem requires each of us to take the room in the business, and let's be a better model to keep women and girls in our own lives.
The current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that determination or success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people for what they are, not as you see.
We all can start by making responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can help people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when did the last time you get a <unk>
In short, we have to work together like communities, as governments and as businesses, to change our culture, so our children grow to be able to be able to be able to value their whole person, the diversity, the diversity, the <unk>
We have to put the people that are really making the difference in a <unk>
So let's make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that come out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world in where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that you can never see the <unk> of being who are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for somebody in their lives.
Who are in mind?
A <unk>
A <unk>
A <unk>
And their <unk>
It could be just the woman who is at two car seats -- what would it mean for her if it was released from that <unk> voice in his interior, that I would give him for not having a long legs -- <unk> more <unk> a more flat feet further.
What would it mean for her if we <unk> this and we would call it to the potential of that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images is <unk> all of us.
But let's get to our kids the truth.
You know, the way you see you is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
<unk> the self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and we compare us to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of today, will become safe agents of themselves in the same morning.
Let's do it.
The five of November November of 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> went to a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
By the <unk> initially they were, but I was involved by other <unk> in the company of others, they started planning for a few 12 icons of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans would be taken out by an informant of the FBI.
Sadly, the pump of 1993 in the World Trade Center, he couldn't help him.
Later, <unk> would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer <unk> with an American mother, an American mother, school in elementary school for giving me a happy childhood, to give me a happy childhood, to give me a happy childhood, to give me a happy childhood, to give me a happy childhood, to give me a happy childhood, to give me a happy childhood, to give me a happy
Just when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims are going to know.
In the experience I saw that when people take time to address it, it doesn't require a lot to get the same things in life.
However, in all of religion in all of human group, there is always a small fraction of people who are <unk> to their convictions that think that we have to use all the possible media so that they all lived as them.
A few months before the arrest he sat up with me and explained to me that in the last weekends of week, he and some friends, had been going to <unk> <unk> in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I was <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on my shoulder and explained to me how to point for about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet he shot -- I gave the little orange light on the goal, and to surprise all of all, especially me, all the goal went on fire.
My uncle turned into the other and Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such a child.
And all of all, the comment made a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what they were as funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be <unk> they would be <unk> by putting a <unk> with 700 pounds of hid in the underground space of the North Trade Center -- causing a explosion that killed six people and <unk> to other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved out 20 times. That instability during my childhood wasn't allowed to make a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about somebody was now a moment of <unk> and go to another city.
As it was always me the new face of the class was often victim of <unk>
It was secret to my identity to avoid being the white -- but it will be the new of the class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't have social skills to put it <unk> from growing under <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
And I was able to be able to be able to judge people, with the basis of <unk> <unk> as their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put to test my way of thinking, was during the U.S. presidential elections.
In a <unk> program in which I was involved in the National Convention in a Philadelphia.
My group <unk> on the subject of juvenile violence, because I had been a victim of <unk> almost my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids who we had done was Jewish was Jewish for.
I took a number of days to go out to the light this detail and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
Never before there was a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud of having been able to beat the barrier that all life had been done to me that was <unk>
Another crucial moment emerged when I got a summer job in Bush <unk> a <unk> park.
I found out people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
All the life had been taught to me that the <unk> was a sin and by breakfast, all gay were bad <unk>
By the chance, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critics I had seen in life.
Having been a kid, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others. But it wasn't easy for me to treat people, exactly how I would have wanted to be treated.
So I was able to contrast the stereotypes that had taught me a kid, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be <unk> but I know what is going to be <unk> for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me be <unk> honest about my <unk> and helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, they have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> <unk> at a moment when I was desperately <unk>
And sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that Jewish comedy would have had a better influence in my life that my own father, <unk> wasn't in avail.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something to keep in my heart forever, while it's alive.
She looked at me with a tired of somebody who has suffered enough <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hatred inside your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope somebody else, one day, who is to take the violence to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, that even though I get to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't have to make me <unk>
Instead, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against <unk>
I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones. For the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism speaking against those acts without any sense, like rejection to my father.
With this simplicity I put up here as a proof that violence is not inherent to no religion or race. That kids don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
At this moment there is a movie that was projected in their minds.
It's an incredible <unk>
It's 3D and has <unk> sound of what you hear and you see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your movie has taste taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood and project to your eyes.
And it has constantly <unk> in your flow of conscious thinking.
The movie of the movie is you who experience everything online.
This movie is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious of us.
We all have an internal film, tea, you and you.
There is nothing to do more directly.
At least I know I have a sense of your own.
I have no certainty that you are conscious.
consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of it, anything in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why are these movies <unk>
Why are we not just robots that <unk> what we get to produce in order to produce the movie <unk>
At this moment, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for consciousness.
The science, for nature, is objective of it.
<unk> for nature, is <unk>
Then there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, we would take that vision.
The psychology was studying behavioral behavior. The neuroscience is a <unk> brain, but no one mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real morality of the scientific work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this kind of fantastic work that presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes.
We now understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or to feel happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of understanding.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to you by saying that this kind of work of neuroscience responds to some questions that we want to explain consciousness.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problems with consciousness.
Because it doesn't address the real core mystery of this <unk> why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by demand.
Why is there an internal movie <unk>
At this time, we can't understand.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon like <unk> as the <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors -- how do we operate <unk> how they work <unk> how they are <unk> and <unk> living organisms are all questions about how it works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how do we talk about how we talk about, how we play <unk> they are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why everything is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a human <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> which works for a long time, hit the head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms.
But at the end of the end I got to the conclusion that it didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to focus on this point.
We have a very wonderful explanations chain -- great. We get used to this, physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this project.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to stop that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think consciousness right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate to our view of the world, but we don't know even how.
With a anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need a few ideas that we were at the beginning of crazy <unk> before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There's some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such a hard problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective subjective film, it includes sort of a illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the brain functions -- the behaviors of the brain. And so you study everything you need explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> <unk>
At the same time, for me and a lot of others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is money.
But I'm going in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as the parallel <unk> space and the mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties is not explain in terms of any more basic terms.
Instead, they think of fundamental -- and then it's built the world.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> found that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- and time, <unk> laws of Newton. So <unk> the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space, time, <unk> <unk> -- then by the question of logic, you have to put it up for the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science, not the object of science.
It opens up the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness to other critical concepts -- space -- the <unk> -- the <unk> <unk>
physicists sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we can put it into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put it into a shirt here.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we do.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for all of us, <unk> for mind, every system is conscious -- not only humans, dogs, mice, the flies, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with anxiety when you think of my little <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, that's not.
But the thought is that perhaps photons can have some <unk> <unk> <unk>
This can sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think something so <unk>
In part that comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is something fundamental <unk>
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people of different cultures, where human mind seems more a continuous with nature.
A more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way to find fundamental laws of finding fundamental laws that we would think of thinking about the physical process.
Whenever there are information processing -- there's consciousness.
<unk> of complex <unk> like in a human being, consciousness complex.
<unk> simple consciousness -- simple consciousness, simple.
Something very exciting is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> with robotic methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information from information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated in a system.
And I'm supposed to <unk> it has to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a degree of information integration of information, as much significant, degree of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the two -- microbes, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration of information, but it's not zero either.
In the theory of <unk> there is still a different level of a different awareness of zero.
In fact, a fundamental law of <unk> <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate awareness to the physical world.
The physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality behind the bottom.
So this is how Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire <unk>
From <unk> vision -- the equations of physics can be able to be able to are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is that he puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness doesn't find out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's in the center.
This is a vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and very serious implications.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that I had consciousness, then I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think it tends to do this, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical and moral <unk> is not so much the fact that your consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing in the way that the answer is yes, if it's conscious of it.
If this is right, you have a really serious ethical problem about the ethic of the development of computer systems and the ethics of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of <unk> the planet.
Canada has their own curiosity.
Or at a local level, a group of integrated group like the audience on a TED Talk -- at this point, we have a TED consciousness, an internal film for this whole group of TED, different from the inner movies of each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually safer than the first crazy idea that consciousness is something fundamental -- that of the second one is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, so many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right way to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, this is probably the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it at night in the morning.
But I think we're finally going to figure it out.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, a low profile of education.
I went to school, I went to my friends with my friends, my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to put it for a prize for the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very beautiful -- but there is a problem.
She didn't really get anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile in the <unk> of my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing to be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school school, so only after about 20 minutes in the TED class of studies -- a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when your <unk>
And I said, "What do you do?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in chairs of wheels, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
<unk> in the classroom.
And it was then when I realized, this child had been experiences with people with disability and <unk>
And we don't know it, and it's not the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people, we are there to inspire us.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for them to tell you, right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we were lying in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold the lie that disability is something <unk> to the capital of capital <unk>
It's something wrong and living with a disability you make a remarkable thing.
It's not a bad thing, and you can't make a remarkable thing.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a huge amount of them.
You may have seen one of the child without hands, drawing with a pen held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with a carbon fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these pictures, which are what we call inspiration <unk>
And I use the porn porn term -- because we would take a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we would get to the <unk> in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life, could be worse.
I could be that one.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of the number of times that I've been doing strange <unk> to express that I think I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I got up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These pictures, those images are going to be <unk> to people with disability in the benefit of people without disability.
They're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a blind person is actually something hard.
We would take some things.
But the things we were in -- are not the things that you can think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was going to become a <unk> social model that tells us that we are more effective because of the society that we live because of our bodies or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
So the things I need to do, and I've learned how to get the best of their capacity as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They're just using their bodies to get the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do that, when we share those <unk>
When people say to us, "You're a source of <unk> it tells you how to believe it.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the problem, because they have sold us this lie that disability makes us remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do.
And I know what you're thinking.
I am here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "Oh God, you're not going to be inspired by somebody else.
And I actually know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all.
However, I don't know that I'm fortunate to them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to collect things that fall over.  <unk> the clever trick of how to charge the mobile phone battery on the <unk>
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk> us.
I really believe that that lie that they have been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in front of a deck of stairs has never done it to become a <unk>
Never.    <unk> to a TV screen will not come up with the <unk> for the <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a nine-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not considered anything to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have that low expectations of the people with disability to be <unk> by getting away from bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the average achievement of people with disability, and I want to live in a world where a child of 11 degree in a high school school is not a little bit surprised that his new teacher is a <unk> user <unk>
<unk> does not make us <unk> but question what you believe to know about what it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and football football with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today just answering one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think of reality <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that is going to happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because virtual reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows you to see what I see.
I'll allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I tried to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would take with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and know what is running through the field of game to 160 <unk> blood hitting the ears.
We can know that a man of 110 pounds would be <unk> trying to do it with all of their being.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
So let's get a few videos to show you what is using Google <unk> under the garage and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they are not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of <unk> technology is a submarine up up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's see a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A moment <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is to be <unk> in the football field from the <unk> perspective.
You may have realized that lack of people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> of the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Swiss <unk> Swiss <unk>
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about feeling in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, will be your favorite players and asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field of <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how we go from <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> that surely many of you know.
<unk> <unk> has been described as the most realistic reality device ever created, and it's not <unk> cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, good.
No, no, no, no, I don't want to follow <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man in a Russian mountain, <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you put a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before I run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan of it.
When it can be <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball at the bottom of the network? Or <unk> making a <unk>
What will be your experience when you go from a mountain to over 100 miles as a <unk> <unk>
Maybe it's <unk> the sales of <unk> for adults.
But this is not even <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we achieve the reality of <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality is augmented reality when the <unk> and the owners see the information of what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So here's a quick role in technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore put a <unk> to his <unk> <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
So in 1994, the <unk> put motion into the <unk> of the field <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player coming back to their group and you see your next thing that you will be shown in front of you, in a plastic string that you are in front of you, you don't have to worry about a <unk>
or the strategy.
They just go into the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if you don't follow their instructions, you lose it, and they hate losing <unk>
If you lose parties to you as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How do you do this?
Well, a very simple choice would be a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people who are down.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is sent to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
You have the bad information <unk>
This <unk> the good teams of bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the analysis of data will stop being just in <unk>
It would be also to <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the <unk>
I got the ball and <unk>
It would take a open open, all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight will tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> Normally, you don't know it, but the system of <unk> you get to <unk>
Let's get to the area of protection.
Another <unk> you tell you that there is a open recovery.
<unk> <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where the receptor can be able to see in your bombsight is an area of grass that lights up and can change the career.
<unk> <unk> <unk> runs and <unk>
The <unk> and the fans have followed the play from each angle.
This is something that will create a massive emotion on the game.
So I'm going to make a lot of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality is part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just as a bread and <unk> like our <unk>
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think that we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, being in the other person.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It takes billions of income a year.
But how much does this technology do for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad is their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth for a gay man in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives <unk>
How much is a <unk> <unk> or a Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think about space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face are <unk> as always, of us.
Thank you.
I recently took myself after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years old, I spent the southern tip of the <unk> County that includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, which is known by their beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for the limb being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Golden <unk> was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much to test <unk>
The suicide from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will bring them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so each of it is released from all of your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to make suicide.
After one every free four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks the bone, some of which we have vital organs.
Most people die in impact.
The ones that no, you know, they are usually <unk> in the <unk> water.
I don't think that those of us who are going to take this method of suicide tells you about the <unk> death of the <unk>
This is the cable up.
Except around the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people are going to have to take care of it.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at its most dark, it's very hard to bring them back.
I took this picture last year as this young man talked to an official watching his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back to the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those of the suicide, but the officials as well.
We have come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new official today.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at the 22 of Julius last year when I get a call from a possible suicide <unk> sitting in the <unk>
<unk> and when I arrived, I looked at Jason talking to an official bridge officer.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, he had flown up to here two times before from New Jersey to try <unk> from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked ourselves if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could curiosity and she opened the box.
She came out and <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> went over to the right, and it was.
This kind of smart and smart guy in New Jersey had just taken out of life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day the next day the family's rabbi struck me.
The parents of Jason had been <unk>
The damage damage to suicide affect a lot of people.
I make these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody loved it was <unk>
What about <unk>
<unk>
In my experience, you don't just have to speak, but you need to hear.
Listening to understand.
No <unk> or say to the person you know how you feel, because you probably don't know it.
Just being there, you can just be the inflection point that they need.
If you think somebody is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way of asking you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to end his life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> to the person in front of you can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to <unk> <unk> believe that there's nothing you can do to <unk> social isolation and a lost of interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your card.
She lost his son the 19 of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with her permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience being there.
I'm thinking I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still pretty <unk> but I see more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the party of 49 percent of her father at 19 of January.
He never got there.
I called the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my home and told me that the Mike car was down the bridge.
One witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for those who can be <unk> too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before without having a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
And the <unk> the Golden Year's Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and go through the path that his son took that day, and also the value to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I mean with hope and value.
On March 11 of 2005, I wrote to a radio called a possible <unk> subject on the bridge of the bridge near the north.
I got my loved thing on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing in the sidewalk.
When he looked at me, he crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the time and the next half and the next half I heard of how Kevin talked about his depression and <unk>
Kevin decided to realize that day will come back to that lane and give her life another chance.
When Kevin goes, <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was what he did to do that <unk> and gave her to hope and life another <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
I stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Lord <unk> nothing to erase the <unk> events of March, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin follows with us.
I believe, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it's been properly <unk>
I got to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious from all those traits -- but thank God, we now know that.
Kevin is in order, like the said.
We give God for you.
I really close with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she write, <unk> <unk> When I visited the General San Hospital of San Francisco that night, you would be <unk> as the patient.
I know I know I had to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and a active member of society.
It talks about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story will inspire others.
suicide is not just something I've found in the work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk> with poison.
That act, despite the end of his own pain, I would give me the chance to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people who are <unk> or those who consider the suicide, don't think they hurt another person.
They just want their own pain <unk>
Usually this is just three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and from suicide around the bridge.
Out of those incidents in which I've been directly involved with them, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
During that time, I got my hand in three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact in that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those few people who have jumped from the bridge and lived and they can talk about it, that one one one one one one one one one of those people have said to the second that they leave from side and they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect <unk> with San Francisco, but also the people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and each of us have to be used to do.
The suicide can be prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but in your inside you know what you are, and a question asks you, how do you get into that?
I have to be a single thing in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model that finally had gotten the dream that I had ever had from a child.
My outside finally <unk> in my inner truth.
For complicated reasons, the ones that I'm going to go over later, when I look at this picture, I think, you see it <unk> <unk> <unk>
But the past October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just beginning.
We are all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the <unk> and the color of the skin or the beliefs of those around us.
These are people who are always going to challenge the status quo -- which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years old, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent even, I ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called epiphany.
This is mine.
I recorded as a <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines in my house, I was always wearing this shirt in my head.
And my mom asked me, "Why do you always take that shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew how to <unk>
The gender is always considered a <unk> but now we know that really, is something more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I never told me to share my story, not because I think it would be a bad thing, but why the world is about those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I thank you to be female.
I have Mom and Dad and a family who accept me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was in a party in the Philippines that there was these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came up to me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me. This is the kind of woman I want to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a contest of <unk> beauty <unk>
That night she said, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk>
He told me that if she <unk> she was fascinated by <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won in the bathroom, I won in <unk> and she was a third <unk> between 40 dollars.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was in the world of <unk> beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first work was a Queen of beauty of women, but I know I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom. I had moved to San Francisco, and he called me and told me that he passed my application from the green card that I could go to live in the U.S.
I <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know that if you get to the United States and you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me that I had two <unk> to my name.
She also joined me when I was <unk> in Thailand for 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand doing the most sophisticated surgeries and safe and secure.
In that time, in the United States, it was necessary to do surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the license assistance with the name <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears were <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living in the truth, but I was able to turn it back to his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our rates of suicide are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of the 20 of November we do a global Oscar for the <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long story of people who were <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
So these are fishermen.
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't continue to live my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best thing to help others live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that one day there is no longer <unk> than 20 of <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
You will ask you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you,   <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. Yeah. First of all, thank you with all my <unk>
My parents in the support of supporting my parents in my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've gone to young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when they were called me and told me that his parents could not take it, I took the phone, and I would take my mom and say, "You can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- others don't. It's just identity identity -- that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, all of us were assigned a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table the theme that some times that task would not block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to be <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
I should have understanding.
I should have space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. <unk> <unk> Thank you.
In many <unk> and tribal societies, the parents usually know about their children, but I'm one of the few parents who is known for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending their rights in 2007. And when they took their efforts in 2011, to <unk> the <unk> National <unk> of peace, became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, it was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the story of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in developing societies right from the beginning, when at birth a child, your birth is not <unk>
It's not safe and his father, not for his mother.
The neighborhood comes next to the mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother got a lot to have a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first girl, the first daughter, he gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when he <unk> her third daughter, it feels guilty as a criminal.
Not just the stem mother -- but the daughter was just <unk> when it grows it as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, you stay home and school determination to her siblings.
At the age of 12 years, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when you go into your own, when it was 13 years old, he gets rid of his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if they <unk> the code of that course. No to kill.
And it's interesting that this code code -- not only the life of a <unk> also affects the life of the male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of his life and happiness of his sisters in the name of honor.
And there is one more norm of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl who has to be very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The good girl model must be <unk>
It's supposed to be <unk> and they accept the decisions of their father and their mother and decisions even if they don't like.
If the <unk> with a man who doesn't like whether or if the <unk> with an old man has to be <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk>
If it was very young, it has to take it up.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> and then it gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to their children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the only one to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And so much before I was thinking about her name, and he was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> and he called my daughter so for her.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she turned out, when I was four and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half years
You might be wondering, why should I mention a girl in a school?
Yes, I have to <unk>
You can take it for sitting in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in societies in tribal societies, it's a great event for life life.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
One of the school that has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future lives.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks before, when I was <unk> the form of <unk> Canadian and was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason it was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters or his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
<unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to put it into their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys in the same.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of <unk>
They taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, sisters, for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of participation of women in all the political and economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were caught up to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk for their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and got up by the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, he was offered her same for the New York Times Times and talked about every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful.
It's <unk> as a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and nine of October 2012, was shot to <unk> in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would take him up to my wife and "I need <unk> by what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And he said, "Please not get you."
<unk> the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play by the cause of the truth, because of the cause of peace, and because of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you get up.
They were both on the right path and God <unk>
These very few words <unk> a lot to me, and I didn't ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and had severe headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve was dead, I used to see a dark shadow that <unk> the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and with the <unk> on my face.
I'm going to be fine. Please do not <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the most difficult, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any girl in 16 years.
<unk> when it's not just his task.
You fight with his brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What are there especially about my <unk> who has done so bold to <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
I say, I'm not wondering what I did.
I did not do what I didn't do.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> from the brain about 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the <unk> group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> but all the work I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did before I join Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you give you to an operation of brain.
You're still like smart or not?
It's not going to be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how to make a little bit of a dozen different chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, they would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about all the combinations and <unk> and try to engage them to keep alive.
More than I've been saved by little.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that we will be able to get the dose of the dose of trying to get the dose of <unk> because there is no really a map of course that will tell you in <unk>
I started trying to test these different <unk> and I was amazed at looking at how small changes in the dramatically dramatically <unk> dose of who was me, my own way of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months and chemical chemical and chemical chemicals for a <unk> man and I was surprised to see how to <unk> my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past I've met several guys like this, or maybe some versions of <unk>
It turned out as an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> to fix a problem that I had in front of it, and it just didn't happen.
So I couldn't handle it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of the men and about the men and what they have to do -- since then I get better with men.
What I was trying to do is that I would adjust those hormones and interact, and so on. I was to recover my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
I think almost always in images, and that became my key reference point -- how to make those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if they were <unk> <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things in the way.
They thought the images and the ideas were the same thing.
Today there is the question of this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how your mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental for thinking and <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I had to find the point right now, and I have already lots of great mental <unk> and it really <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director was able to use their imagination only to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There's incredible possibilities with this, as the way people creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply increase the resolution of our brain imaging systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments made by two groups in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, <unk> imaging -- to represent the brain here, and you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person who looks at a image.
The middle of the middle shows the brain scan of that single individual as you were looking at that same image.
The column on the right is created <unk> the content of the central column of the left, you see that the difference is almost dangerous.
This was <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar result.
The difference between seeing an image and imagining that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is the lab of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn the brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, I showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube YouTube while they took their brains to create a big sequence of brain reactions to video video.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as well as it was <unk> a new <unk>
The computer, using just the brain information in the scan of the scan -- to show you what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This gave us <unk>
We're pretty close to this.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you can imagine that same image, it creates in the brain the same <unk>
This led to the brain scanning brain systems that are available today, and its resolution will become a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we get it?
There are many techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I didn't give me to that.
A lot of them are proposing new techniques of projection for images, even I, <unk> with the recent result of the MRI -- first we must ask, this technology is going to be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with larger magnets -- but to this point, magnets more <unk> just offer small improvements in the resolution, not increases by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: rather than magnets bigger, let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different things, like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI were to make magnets really big, right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> of nice, brilliant and brilliant and brilliant and bright solutions in <unk> and <unk> in the connections and a lot of FM radio <unk>
In turn, instead of a magnetic field, they were able to <unk> magnetic magnetic patterns.
So by combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the radio processing patterns -- we can increase the information that you can get in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then divide our growing knowledge of the brain structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
When we use the <unk> we should be able to measure not just the blood fluid.
We're going to be able to put our ideas into a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking.
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be used to use it as a tool to amplify our skills of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have a few choices more than open this door.
Anyway, you choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not just a traditional sense, not just the gay.
I think we all have <unk>
And so she might be saying to some person for the first time you love the love or tell someone who's pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or any other hard conversation why you have done in life.
So all of this is a hard conversation -- and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have gone from that quest to be universal.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it has to happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working in the South Side of <unk> <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through several stages from the intensity of <unk> <unk> I didn't have a <unk> to quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I'm going to be slope from the <unk> of my short <unk> and I've got my head a little bit, I would ask myself a little bit of a kid -- "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And it would be a uncomfortable silence on the table.
I got my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a stop <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother passed a cold, look at his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and <unk> in it.
And I got to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years old, was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised me that next time I would say something.
I should have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was prepared and I was about to enter the female issues on the table.  He had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Even a clip of the "Vagina Monologues" <unk>
So I take a lot down, and I went down and my backs of a girl in four years with a dress dress looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a little girl with a question: "You're a little girl or <unk>
So I take up a lot of the way back, and I set up <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something else.
I have the short hair like a kid, and I saw a girl, but I am a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a little bit of <unk>
Now, I'm more than a girl in a <unk> <unk>
And that little girl looked at me by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and it has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all right. "Oh, you're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest conversation that I ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, I often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But in the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how a sense of it feels like being living in a closet.
This is how I think it's not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> I'll give you 100 reasons why I was going to get out of my life, so it was harder than coming out of your hand, but this is the <unk> <unk> <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that you will explain to somebody who has declared <unk> it's harder than saying it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story I say is harder than saying to your son five years that you're going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, there is no hard thing.
We need to stop making what we're hard to do about what it is difficult for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we must just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
In some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make sense of security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what they are made on their walls, a lifetime is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine themselves, 20 years ago.
I, I had a horse tail -- a dress and shoes.
It was not the youngest sentences to fight any child in four years to go into coffee.
I was frozen by fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark life, <unk> my gay, <unk> and moving only a muscle is the hardest thing that ever done.
My family, my whole complete strangers that I've spent my whole life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was going back to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> to kill.
One of my most memorable propelled <unk> was at my sister.
It was the first time that many of the invited knew that I was gay, and when I do my <unk> lady in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came up to one where the friends of my parents, people who knew I was doing years ago.
And after speaking for a moment, one of the women who are <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the battle of gay history.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it <unk>
<unk> meet my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what's your favorite TV show.
Our favorite show Will and Grace and Grace and Grace and Grace and Grace and Grace and Grace and Grace and Grace and Grace and Grace
And you know who was <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in waiting for me desperately to show her support, to get me to know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband is wearing <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, as they have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask for somebody, but <unk>
If you are going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing to do it.
It's like the hard conversations continue to be my strong point.
Ask anybody that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I still like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but you understand that what it involves going out of any self is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in coffee had no <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> others must know that we also exist.
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they could be gay, they will keep the hope that that could change.
Don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and most important <unk>
You communicate your truth.
You would never get rid of that.
And some of them can go out of sure, <unk> <unk> for what they've done, but it's never obsessed with what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you are feeling <unk> but that's something in them.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark look like a <unk> you have to know that we've all been there before.
And you can feel very close to you, but they're not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence, an productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of if a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism to the pioneers of computing as Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, I took a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's go back a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they are a <unk> race that you don't know anything about the biology of the Earth or the neuroscience of the Earth not from Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredible lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that doesn't have any concept of intelligence on Earth, would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to a certain moment in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a planet <unk> stop doing it.
And that's why I claim that this is the same question that I understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led to a number of years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that I think, I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be based on the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that will make the diversity of possible future.
And finally, in the open-source movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have been trying to leverage the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so, by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I asked, asked, since many years ago, there's a underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's just a equation for the <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a statement that intelligence is a force, F, that acts with the end of maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open choices with a red force with the diversity of possible accessible, and yes, to an impending time, <unk>
In a few words, the intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintain the open.
And so, having this equation, it's natural to ask, what can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the human intelligence level.
<unk> intelligence is <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that produce more <unk> or <unk> during their life should have to be more relevant to the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that connection <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What happens if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually it comes directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy production in any system where you find in it.
<unk> <unk> could spend multiple evidence of animal intelligence, play with human intelligence, and even make money <unk> actions, all of it without you to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human foot of standing up here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance is going to have applications for the <unk> <unk> and human care.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, like some other animals can cooperate by throwing opposite lines of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can perform a version of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a game of <unk> against themselves, <unk> their potential for play.
So here we can see <unk> Create new connections into a social network where the friends are constantly <unk> and keeps the network of the very connected network.
This same capacity of network <unk> also has applications in health care, in energy and intelligence.
So here we see <unk> organize the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering success and using the Panama Canal to expand the global level to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems with civil defense and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously to discover and run a <unk> strategy in a simulated series of negotiation -- successfully increasing the assets under their exponentially.
This ability of risk management will have vast applications in finance, and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of human cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walk upright and social cooperation -- all flows from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the use of the term <unk> the work -- there was always the concept that if we <unk> smart machines, there would be a <unk>
The machines <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of the rebellion <unk> to the other way.
It's not the machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the other thing that the impulse to take control of all the possible future is a very fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually emerge directly from taking control, rather than being the other way to be.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how is it that we look for goals -- this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to go to the descendants of the descendants to help them build artificial artificial opinion or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a turning point in human history, something between the country of stars and losing the planet we call <unk>
At the last few years, we've expanded a lot of our knowledge of how the Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The Kepler Kepler has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting about other stars, which points that Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope which measures the faint intensity of stars when the planets go through in front of them, and they have a little bit of that light that we get to us.
The data was collected by Kepler -- they show the sizes of planets in addition to the distance between them and their mother.
And together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth's planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their own.
At turn, this gives clues about if these planets that we find are true or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this embodied of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
Last year, it was the <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us since millennia, are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have been rapidly <unk> our ability to alter their course.
But I am not the weather scientist or <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that I look for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in the pursuit of life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the planet just discovered and planets that we know better, our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially technological world, demonstrated this for a mission like <unk>
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been habitable in the past and part of it is why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> they get out of the surface of the origins of life as well as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> as the <unk> mission take samples from the atmosphere <unk> and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies now offer not just short space flights but also the possibility of living on Mars.
But despite all of these <unk> images, they remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still going to be <unk> places that are really <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry places in the Earth the air is cool and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this enthusiasm is on the size of Mars and other planets and <unk> with a great sad and sad thing, the implication of some that Mars is waiting for us to save from this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly dramatic to Earth.
And so I like the exploration of exploration -- I'm deep disagree with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to <unk> humanity is as imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the party of truth will have place later in the <unk>    Thank you.
But the goals for exploration of <unk> and civil preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of power, preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk>
They're just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep <unk> places in the hostile and hostile spaces of Earth, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
Let me leave you with an experiment -- the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi did, he asked, having to realize that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the life of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider to be living in between the stars, they lose the notion of how important planets that we have to protect this development.
This is <unk> to think that only produces us to save us from ourselves, but civil preservation and exploration and exploration of <unk> can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to put into the hostile environments of Mars for human presence for human presence -- then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I got my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were on the dining table, where there was <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other windows and windows, and they were all okay up.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an flight early to Europe to the next morning, and my <unk>
<unk> expensive, but surely not more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought, that despite the circumstances, I worked right now.
I am a business neurologist and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rate -- <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk> thinking.
And when I got to the counter <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a long time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that could put in their place, which was going to be bad things.
Or at least if bad things happen to be bad things, that you will give you the likelihood that it is a total catastrophe going on.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts didn't be <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> <unk> from the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he told him that I broke the window, and I had forgotten my desk.
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years before, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what the <unk>
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts comes and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that could go wrong, then tries to figure out what it can do to prevent the things that are going to be done or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about is some of the things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
On the house, you get a place for the things that are very easily.
This sounds kind of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a tracking of the location of the important things, where the way the fish are, where the fish are, where the fish are <unk> where the tribes are friends in and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that will be <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows you to find them to find their nuts.
And if you ask if somebody really did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing keys from the car, reading and <unk>
So at home you get a place for the keys, a hook along the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For her spouse a particular guy.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you go to a place and they are <unk> with that stuff is always there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take with the cell phone a picture of your credit credit card license to buy it by email itself to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can be <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases you.
<unk> is toxic and <unk>
