You know that what I do is to write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, more read in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like this.
And I can assure you that I can <unk> or with clothing and clothing and <unk> and no one has chosen a <unk>
Today I'm here to talk today about this today.
And you know that a well-being, it's usually something that goes into a place.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a <unk>
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk> did that -- Richard <unk> did that -- I did it.
It's the kind of complicated circle of which I'm going to show you.
And my circle began in the early years in the middle of the middle school in <unk> <unk> where I was the rare in the classroom.
When I was <unk> until I was able to tap into the bathroom for the boys, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life when I went into the bathroom of the family.
I did it.
for three years, for three years.
And I had to go from the city.
And I had an appliance, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the years, I felt the need to start the need to start working in organizations that they were fighting against it.
About three or four years ago, in the middle of the night I got a phone call from the <unk> the lady <unk> who said, "You know what?
I'm <unk> that adults never come to us.
You might be able to get rid of it, and please take that man that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to do it with this.
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see us, <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found one place, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of his family, because it was worth their family, because it was possible.
It's something we knew how to do.
And so as the woman I wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> it became a box of ashes and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had become a circle -- it had become a circle -- and that ethic that I told you was done in each other.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save the world.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy to talk about this.
It also needs -- needs -- love and <unk> -- and it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
As an artist, a connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I am trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and all of these things.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can fast, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
And I looked at me around the water about 60 feet and I couldn't even more to think that it was about a <unk> on another <unk> year after year.
They are born when they are born when they have the glaciers in the glaciers or they eat the barriers of <unk>
Every time it has its own mental value.
They have a different way to interact with their environment.
Some of you will say to me and you get rid of it until the end, while others can't <unk> more and more <unk> in a <unk> of passionate <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated up and you know, as we see ourselves as we see ourselves as human beings.
But the reality is all the opposite.
As a result, as a <unk> I'm breathing its atmosphere.
As a result, it turns out that it turns out to be a <unk> fresh water in minerals that feeds a lot of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if I was trying to make the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are only that way of that way -- and it won't be there.
It's not the death of the death -- it's not an end, but one next thing on its way through the cycle of life.
Now part of the ice in the middle, that is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years ago.
And another part of the ice has over 100 years.
The last photos I would like to show you are a <unk> which I photographed in <unk>
It's unlikely to actually actually witness a <unk>
Here they go.
You can see on the left a little bit.
<unk> about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the <unk> and its <unk>
You can see here, the boat starts to <unk> the ship has moved into the other side and the man is there.
This is a <unk> <unk>
<unk> from the water about about 120 feet or 40 feet long.
This video is in real time.
And so we <unk> the <unk> a different side of his personality.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day at the same time, exactly at the same time, every single day.
So two couples each one with a baby.
I don't want you to be <unk> too much in the details, because if you stop thinking about it, you won't be paying attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm is held by the <unk>
And in the other case, the sperm was held by the chromosome from the <unk>
And both <unk> and it starts life.
So let's talk about them later.
In my field, I will be able to get two legs.
In one of my <unk> work with the story of the <unk>
I am a <unk> and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- which is, of human bodies, and <unk> how have we been considered <unk>
The other role that performance in my work is the fact that I am a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are dead.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics are caring for social media.
I've been working for instance, with identical twins <unk> two people inside a body.
I've been working with people with <unk> people much lower than that.
And I've been working with many cases of people with sex with individuals whose physical forms doesn't fit in the <unk> male and national <unk>
In particular, we can <unk>
The <unk>
I'm going to put some examples in ways of having sex with sex that doesn't exist in the common forms or <unk>
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose gene cells of the chromosome -- and it says to the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life.
And then, in the life of <unk>
But because this individual is unable to breathe, the body is not <unk>
It's about <unk>
So there are high levels of terrorism.
As a result, the body is develop a course called <unk>
When we <unk> the baby has a <unk>
It's a <unk>
And often, it's not until puberty, you are growing up and developing countries, but it doesn't have the menstrual period when someone realizes that something is going on.
And then they put them together, they realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and a chromosome called <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not really that.
women, as men, as men, we have in the body called <unk> glands <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
The <unk> glands make it <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like me, I think, is a <unk> woman who doesn't know his <unk> structure -- I think it's a typical woman -- most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
And <unk> and we answer the <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has <unk> <unk> to the <unk>
So sex is something different. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain way, in a certain way.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a guy from 19 years old, born and raised as <unk> had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, he had a life as a kid and had just found that he had <unk> and <unk>
I had a extreme form of a disease known as <unk>
And I had chromosomes and in the Solomon Islands.
And as a result, they were <unk> their brain was exposed to the ecological component of the world's population.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk>
And it was at 19 years ago when he started to have <unk> problems caused by the <unk> <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, was woman in there.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with chromosomes develop what it is known as <unk> is to say, they have tissue <unk>
We don't know what happens at that.
So there's a lot of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies is that they are <unk> identical twins or <unk> or <unk> or <unk> -- not so much of a better health than a better human health.
In many cases people are perfectly happy.
So the reason why you get to a number of surgeries is that they're a threat for our social problems.
The system is based usually in the idea that a particular anatomy is completely <unk>
We have the idea that being woman is to have an identity <unk> to be black to be black to be black in terms of <unk>
an extraordinary idea.
And when it gets us a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with the <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture.
Our nation is based on a concept of <unk>
Imagine the amazing thing that is a children who are born as two people within a same body.
The most recent case is last year with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> put into his sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to ask, "What test is going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is no such one.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't apply a <unk> line between men and women or women or women and women and women -- we are the people who we map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we apply the science, the more we have to admit that these categories -- we thought these categories were very stable -- that they were able to move directly to categories -- they are much more <unk> of what they were doing.
And not only in terms of sex.
It's also in terms of race, something that's much more complicated than the next.
As we see, we go into a <unk>
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA on the Internet.
What do we do in the fact of the <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as you go back in the science we get into the science and becoming more in a good area in which we have to recognize that the categories of <unk> are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in every single human life.
One of them is, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the ones at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to find a moment from which a body becomes human and has become different from the <unk>
There are very few conversations today in <unk> today not in public, but I know within the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>
Our ancestors had never had to be <unk> with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of you put a pen in front of your nose and if you were still not <unk>
If I went to move it.
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs of a body and put them into another body.
And as a result, we need to deal with the prisoner's dilemma to actually actually determine the death of me, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be replaced by somebody like me.
In politics I am a severe <unk> to people with anger, but I have to admit that I have to admit that I was going to be there.
<unk> that these categories are much more affected from what we thought was going to happen.
<unk> from the point of view.
And to tell you about this tension first I have to admit that I am a cross-section of the <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were <unk>
I mean, they were so brave and so radical in what they did, that I find that I find a lot of that musical <unk> <unk> and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
So what happened in <unk> with the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> was to me, the first activists of the anatomy and <unk> and <unk>
What they did was it was a <unk> concept, and it was <unk> with another that was radical and beautiful and beautiful for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what we call our <unk> <unk> was the idea of the <unk> the monarchy was in a very simplistic concept, of the world.
The researchers in the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of a <unk>
They had the concept of water.
They were about the idea that they were going to become political power by the right of their blood passed from the father of the father and then to son, and then to son, and then to son, and then to son, and then to son, and then to son, and then to son, and then to son, and then to son, and then to son, and then to son,
<unk> <unk> I got that idea and put it for a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created the same thing.
They <unk> the field of game and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy of the common and not <unk> differences -- that was something quite different.
And in part they were doing it because they are part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> the science.
And it gets very clear if you look at the story of <unk> <unk> that many of them were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to be passed through this idea of a <unk> idea of <unk>
They were moving towards a <unk>
And if you go back for example, the Declaration of <unk> they talk about nature and the god of <unk>
They're not talking about God and the nature of God.
The power of nature is to tell us who we are.
And as a result, we were applying the idea of the coincidence of the best.
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future of civil Rights
They didn't think that they didn't think of that way, but they did it.
And what happened next?
And the women <unk>
Then the success of the movement of the Civil Rights Movement with people of <unk> <unk> who said, "I am not a <unk>
We found men in the room of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a <unk>
Again, people of color who are going to get to the coincidence of <unk> and again, <unk> <unk> <unk>
We see the same thing.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep a few <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give a fish the same rights to a human.
I don't want to say that we should have <unk>
I don't want to say that the children of five years would allow them to be able to have sexual relationships, or <unk>
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me have sense and that I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why do they get it into and if they have any sense.
Well, let's go back to those two kinds of things.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in <unk> the same day.
Let's imagine that one of them, who was born was born three months before I was <unk> the one one of June 14, 17, 12.
Instead, she was born in <unk> was born on an March of June 14, 15, 16, 17, 15, 16, 17, 11, 12.
For the fact of having been born three months before Mary asked her all three months before Henry the right to Henry <unk> the right -- the right to the right-hand side.
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a very different age, but because she was born again.
We found other <unk> in relation to their <unk>
And in virtue of being considered man -- if I don't have told you if it's <unk> in virtue of being considered a man now is a man who is now <unk> from the storyteller that Mary doesn't have to understand.
They will not have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry he can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can get married with a woman in some sense.
So we still have <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is, what do we do now that the science came so much in the field of anatomy that we got to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could <unk>
I don't want to give it to science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is going to happen.
And where are you?
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to stick the line on some side so that we're going to do it.
But a lot of people are stuck in a room.
For example, Texas at a certain point has decided to get married with a man who has no chromosome to get chromosome from, and that to marry a woman you have to have chromosome about.
Now in the practice they don't make <unk>
But this is also very strange for the story that I told you at the beginning of <unk> <unk>
If you look at one of the founders of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, is in his "I love <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the content of its <unk> going beyond the <unk>
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea seems to be really interesting.
But in practice, how are you from?"
How do we judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point to you also that I'm not sure that we should be sure that we should be able to do it to people, because I have to admit that I know that some of the <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than I know.
I also mean that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more decisions and <unk> about their sexual relationships, that people from 40 that I know.
So how do you put in practice of the <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And a part of me is what if the character of a person could be in the future being measured by an instrument, maybe with an instrument, maybe with an idea.
We really want to get to that point.
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still going to be able to get this current understanding of the subject of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels guilty for other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless it's willing to expand to a change of sex, in which case you can live to live today.
We're not in that situation.
I'm really happy to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon who talked about a couple of years ago that I had done to give birth identical twins <unk> and so forth.
But when the phone asked the phone reason to be a very <unk> operation, I realized that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
And what I said, "Well, it has considered civil war, rather than <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities to people to be who are not <unk> to change at the same time.
So I think we need to be on the head.
Well, to try to say that I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about how it would be democracy, or as it might have been, if we were given greater participation to <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit about, a little bit of a <unk> and that is that I think there can be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking in group.
Since years years ago, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in doing the same thing.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know from <unk> studies is that women on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to the complex relationships and to worry about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
A few years ago, when I was in the middle, one of my favorites I knew I was interested in <unk> <unk> I thought to myself, as a <unk> I made a <unk>
<unk> what is <unk>
And I thought, "It's the hardest question I've ever seen.
And he did have to do with it, but it has nothing to do, so there's nothing in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about your question, most of you have been kind of a female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something different on average, something different between the female brain and the male who makes us more <unk> to the complex relationships and willing to help the most distant lives.
So if you do that, you were very excited to find the way to protect the people from the state, you may be able to get them more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have measured the concept of protection from the support of the support of the city.
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we take democracy beyond the <unk> thinking less in the individual body in terms of identity, in terms of identity, in terms of identity, in terms of identity, to think more about things.
So as we try to create a more perfect, think about what we do about the others.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
In 2007 in 2007, I decided that we had to expand how we think about economic growth.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinking about where they want to go to live and work, have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are <unk> to attract new needs.
Well, at this point, we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't tell you with a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that you get a lot more than its <unk>
So we could easily take it into the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But we just got to <unk>
Imagine that half of those who would like to live in apartments were already identified and that the other half still <unk>
You could actually try to increase the ability to do <unk> in all sorts of ways.
But you know that the problem that we <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that all around the world have rules to avoid the <unk> and the boreal <unk>
So it would be very difficult to do all those things.
But you could go to a totally new place to build a totally new apartments with a completely new apartments -- always -- and when the rules of that place <unk> the building instead of putting a <unk>
So I proposed that governments are <unk> new areas of big reform and large cities, and I gave them a big <unk>
I later realized that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of democracy.
Did you know that every year about 75 percent of their country would go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in general?
In the summer of 2009 <unk> I spent a lot of time.
In the next choices, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which <unk> reforms have been <unk> and at the same time.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
While I was preparing to give you a talk at TED.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a great amount of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their own ideas.
The first point was the importance of computers, like those rules that tell you that you can't go and go into all the possible residents to get them out of it.
<unk> a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need both of technologies like <unk> and they usually are the rules that you get to be able to do.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of mine sent me to <unk> a link to the <unk>
I showed it to you.
They were wrong.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we got together in a room at a conference room with a <unk>
I tried to explain to explain to you about how valuable the cities, that are the cities, much more valuable than their <unk>
And I used this picture that shows the value of <unk> in a place like New York City.
But it was a pretty abstract argument, and at some point, when there was a <unk> <unk> he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk>
And the talk was described in a very simple terms, which a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> <unk> a <unk> which is <unk> the rules that <unk> the rules that you have, if you want to go out or not live under those circumstances.
So the president of <unk> was called me, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this might be the way that our country has to be.
He asked me to go to <unk> and talk again about four and five of them.
So I presented another talk full of data, which is a picture like this, which was to explain to you that to explain to you a lot of value to a city, this has to be very large.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that we built in <unk>
Just this graph takes over 100 miles away.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a place that was at least 1,000 miles away.
That's over 100,000 years.
Everyone in the world.
The faces of the public were very serious and <unk>
The leader of the Congress came up to the platform and said, <unk> <unk> a lot of thanks for your talk, but maybe you could see the video of the <unk>
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat up and showed the <unk>
And this explained what a new city can do with new choices for people.
There would be an option of a city that could go to that could be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away to the end.
And also new choices for their lives.
Because the leaders of the government of <unk> would need help in <unk> countries, they could benefit from the countries that would help them to establish and make the rules of the <unk> so that they all could rely on the <unk>
We went and we saw it.
This picture is there.
I could easily get it easily away.
And shortly after 19, 19 of January, voted on Congress to <unk> their government, and add a chance to be able to create these special regions that would allow us to create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> <unk> the voting in Congress for this <unk> <unk> was <unk> to one.
All of the sudden, all of those girls in society, the <unk>
For <unk> in the <unk> you have to spend two times on the ground.
On February 17 years later, he passed over again on another one.
Immediately after the age of September at 24 to 24 months ago, a couple of <unk> <unk> was to the two places in the world that are more interested in construction in building cities.
One of them is South Korea
This is a picture of a new great city center of the city that is building in North Korea is bigger than the United States.
Everything that you see there were built in four years, after four years getting the <unk>
The other country was interested in building cities.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they are being preparing for a question.
And if you think about this, this is the point where you are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a place for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> and to allow them to operate under an external immune system.
A country already has committed to allow the Supreme Court to be the court of the last time that this new system.
There are <unk> and the cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some of them.
But the only thing we know that they've already solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are many companies who wanted to go back in the <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there are many people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who tell them that they would like to immediately go back to another place.
There is a million a year that comes from Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to go to get a job, sometimes they have to win the money to make the money to eat or buy them.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are children who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it look like in building a new city in <unk>
Or to build a dozen this, or a hundred of these all around the world.
What does it look like for the families that families can choose between various cities that are <unk> to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends -- I was asked to say, "Thank you.
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what you are going on, I'm going to make a public mistake, and that's what I live with.
I love to find, and more recently, and more recently, it was to photograph and publish on my blog <unk> <unk> and different <unk> for each other.
But it doesn't work.
All my clothing is a second hand of <unk> markets, and <unk> stores of <unk>
Oh, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> I'm allowed to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
And I started to meet people with the fact that usually my money goes to a good <unk> My favorite thing is <unk> and buying it becomes my personal search for <unk>
And what I'm going to do is to say, what am I going to do?
I'm going to be on my own.
I like to call it a <unk>
cost less than 20 percent.
If all the answers are true, then I feel that I've won.
So to come back to the topic of my <unk> I want to tell you what I'm going to tell you about.
I mean, what does it take to get someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you.
I've brought seven pairs of clothing and something.
<unk> inside a week is everything I've put in my <unk>
I imagined that it would be able to find everything else that I'd like to use after you get to the <unk>
And because I don't know how the woman walks up to TED in the wrong clothing --  that means I found some things.
And I would like to show you how it works.
It doesn't sound good.
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, and I've learned that in this adventure we don't use to use <unk>
We're going to start with it.
So I call this one.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see it.
Almost you can always see it at least 50 dollars.
All the together, including the <unk> and the <unk> and the most expensive that I've used on this week.
<unk> the color is <unk>
It's almost impossible to be <unk> impossible to be bad at, when you're wearing a little red line.
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people.
<unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.

If you get rid of the right people -- not only you can do it.
<unk> <unk> from the child that you take in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to be going to play the <unk> or that I remember his little seven years of seven years.
I like to <unk> and say, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key question.
If you think that you look well with something, it is almost certain that it is.
And if you think you don't know well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day.
But it wasn't up until the 30 years that I really understood its emotional experience.
And I'm going to give you a few examples.
If you believe that you're a beautiful person inside your inside and outside, you don't see that you can't see it.
So there's no excuse for anyone from this audience.
We need to be able to get everything we want to do.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
<unk> a truly universal word for you. <unk> <unk> <unk>
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal lifestyle and only one way is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to tell a story.
I've tested it again and again when people came up with me this week just by what I was doing, and we had conversations with them.
And obviously it's not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went back home, I would like to read it.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn about this week is that you have to get back to certain things.
I don't need <unk> <unk> to these things, because at the back of the corner, there will always be another crazy suit -- <unk> and brilliant <unk> -- if there's a little bit of love in my heart and <unk>
Many thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two ways.
The left side is the <unk> and the right side of the right side, which is the part of it.
So if we put a scale on a scale to measure the <unk> we could design a plane of our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely wrong.
This would be somebody who is completely wrong.
So where are you <unk> your brain in this way?
Some <unk> for one of these inventor, but I think that for most people in this audience, your brain is something -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they are <unk>
You can be sick.
I think one of those people, that just like most of the other physical physicists -- we need a pretty logic <unk> we need more logic to <unk> these ideas.
But at the same time, we need pretty much more intuition to make the experiments really happen.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them playing with them and then we see them as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do that.
And the intuition that you can have developed is the step of the years is that one thing is that one thing can be in a place at the time.
I mean, it may sound a little bit weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you were not born with this <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing on a piece of paper.
It was a little kid, and I did not do it very well, and I didn't really know.
But I bet the play with that bar of parking lot was taught a valuable lesson, and that is that the big things don't allow the <unk> and they stay in a place.
This is a great scientific model that you can have in the world, except that you are a physicist in <unk>
It would be a terrible model for a physicist of particles, because they don't play with cars, they play with these strange <unk>
And when you play with their particles, they discover they do all kinds of things really weird things -- as you can go through walls, or you can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these fears, and they called the theory of quantum mechanics alone.
At that point in that point I found the physics of a few years of quantum mechanics to describe these little <unk>
But not the need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That doesn't really mean very well to me, and maybe it's because I don't want to play a lot of it.
Well, sometimes play with them.
And I never know.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it doesn't really work.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then I should not keep on the principles of quantum mechanics <unk>
I don't find the reason why it doesn't work.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics alone.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do this.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been on a <unk>
What we see here is a little bit of a computer.
And you can try to see the green point right in the <unk>
That's the piece of metal that I'm going to talk about in one minute.
This is a picture of it.
And here's what I'm going to show you.
And then here we do a lot of very well in the small <unk>
So what we see is a little bit of <unk> <unk> and that is <unk> in a <unk>
And then I did this almost in the same way that I would make a computer.
I went to a clean room with an enormous chip chip and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to do this kind of <unk> <unk> that you find out of the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum mechanics, but for it needs a little bit of a bit of play.
Let me give you an example.
You know what's uncomfortable about being in a <unk>
I mean, when I'm in a <unk> I do all sorts of things, but then when another people come up to do these things, because I don't want to <unk> or, actually, I want to <unk> or, actually, <unk>
quantum mechanics says that visual objects are related.
The colleagues on the <unk> objects are not just people, but it's also the light that we <unk> and the wind that happens to its side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little metal piece of metal to the quantum mechanics, we would have to find all the other <unk>
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then then put it up and put it all over the air, and then you get it to a temperature of less than a degree above all.
Now, by being in the <unk> the little metal piece of metal is free to act as a <unk>
And so we measured them.
I discovered that it was moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly hard, I was <unk> and the way it was <unk> was like a breath of this way -- like a <unk> that will expand and <unk>
And by giving a soft <unk> we were able to do it -- and we didn't know at the same time -- something that only happens with the quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you about is something that I'm telling you.
What it means is that one thing that means is that one thing, and not <unk>
So let's think about it.
In one case, all of the atoms of atoms that make up that piece of metal are being lost and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down to go.
It's just in certain <unk> when those <unk>
In the rest of the time.
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, what it means is that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
From true.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years, because, look at this, the difference in scale between one and one of metal is more or less metal than the difference between that piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom I could be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you get a <unk>
I mean, it's my logical part of it.
So imagine if you were in various places at the same time, how would it be that? How would it be that?
How do they use your consciousness if your body was <unk> in your life?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when you get it, and you get the lights and you look at the lights and you look inside the metal and you see that metal was still there on one side.
And I was able to get to this new stages of all the objects in the game, actually are just <unk> objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about the quantum mechanics of quantum mechanics that are all different.
Well, that's not so easy.
It's more than that, it's more than that.
It is that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are. And that's the profound origins of quantum mechanics there.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And I spent 18 months on Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art in my head that is here and that allowed me to take it up.
It took me 18 months and so on.
A lot of stories and stories, it was <unk> with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think that my own story is explains just this slide and this is the <unk>
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- I don't know me, but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
And so, when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning it.
And working at Google, I try to do the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team of people, and we started doing it.
So what I'm showing you is the demo for then to explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've taken over the world.
So we are going to <unk>
Look around all of the museums that are there.
It's the gallery gallery and the <unk> <unk> the <unk>
In fact, I'm going to go into one of my favorite <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do it.
We are going to click and <unk> we're already in the process.
No matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that actually doesn't matter.
You move around and you get <unk>
They want to navigate it.
And we put on the top down, and with one another.
They're inside, you want to go at the end of the room.
You've got to go back.
<unk> <unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to it.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings -- <unk> <unk> <unk>
I see the <unk>
If the museum shows us the picture, we can click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here is all the data.
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click on, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured on what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 times.
And there are many people who tell me, "And what you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you actually get with 10,000 million dollars.
It can be done in a very simple way.
You see things that are happening.
I love this guy, your expression doesn't have any price.
But if you really love <unk>
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I went back and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
It was a little bit, I talked to some of the people of the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> <unk> which is to hit a stick with a stick with a dog.
And as it was very difficult.
I don't know why they did it, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to make it even more in depth and you'll see that you can actually get even even more <unk>
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take the picture, so you can actually see what it looks like.
Here's where we were, and this is the picture.
The best thing is to come up with the <unk>
So now we're going to jump again again again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another of my favorite ones.
The example I showed was to find it.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how they're going to actually write this <unk>
And it turns out that it doesn't really work.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the end.
This is the <unk> night -- I think I never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorites.
There are lots of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part called <unk>
All of you, all of you, no matter what, no matter if it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you a <unk>
You can actually create their own museum, create their own collection from all of these pictures from all these pictures from all these places.
It's very simple -- I have created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we just have to do a <unk>
It's about <unk> <unk> in the National Park.
You can put things on things, send them to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel when you look at these things.
So in conclusion, I think that for me, the main thing is that all of the incredible things really come from this.
No, in my mind, even the <unk>
Maybe I should not say this.

And that's been my career.
I mean, I hope that in this digital digital form of the art of art and that is represented in line.
And the great question that they do today is that they are doing this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It is to change.
And that's everything.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Okay? Thank you.
I have something to say.
Think about this is a <unk>
In our lab we call it <unk>
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I am about all the kids in Italy actually grow up with this picture on the wall of its <unk> but the reason I show you this is that it's a very interesting thing in terms of <unk> one in the last two decades.
A few years ago, if you wanted to win a career, you would take a budget and put it to a good pilot and a good car, and a good car, and a good car, or a good car, or a good car, or a <unk>
And if the car and the pilot were good enough for me, you had my career.
This is what in engineering, the <unk> systems of control in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now, what's interesting is that the control systems are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're coming back to the air.
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is something new.
As a note later, I wanted to mention cities that cities are only two percent of the planet but represent 50 percent of the population.
For 80 percent of the <unk> consumption of <unk> and even 80 percent of the CO2 emissions per year.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be something new.
More than the cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are coming in our lives.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for the <unk> in <unk> in the <unk>
It's called <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start to <unk>
In a certain way, it is as if almost every existing atoms are coming out and <unk>
And that's because it's changing the interaction that as humans have with the outer environment.
In a sense, it's almost like in the old dream of <unk>
You know, when <unk> <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end I took the <unk> and it turned it into the Netherlands, -- that you can still see a little <unk> <unk> and he said <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a couple of examples here in the idea of capturing the environment and we get something.
Let's start with the beginning.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was about four and a half years ago.
It was a summer in 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Trade Center,
Maybe some of the things that some of you remember writing and France, and at the end of the <unk>
And anyway, at the end of the day.
Now let's see what happened that day looking at the activity of the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk>
It's the morning, before the game is.
The time is at the top.
On the afternoon there are people over here and there doing this.
It begins with the <unk>
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a quick call and goes into <unk>
Thank you.
There was a long time ago.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
It makes sense.
That night they were all at <unk>
You see the big deal.
The next day they were all at the center of the <unk> team and the first minister of time.
And then everybody else.
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time -- people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how today you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things that we use and we choose and we think.
Today we know all of the things about our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that are <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project in this project we developed some little tags to track the garbage in its own universe.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that were all about.
And then we put a little chip, one hand on the trash and then we start <unk>
These are the problems.
And you can see here.
After a week.
With this information we realized that there are many <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing.
These are data that before we didn't know.
They're going on different things, and there's a lot of energy.
But the other thing that we believe is that if we look at all the days that the cup that we <unk> it is still somewhere on the planet, it's still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle of plastic that goes on there, there is still still there.
We show that if we show people that, then we can promote some change of life.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> I could tell you much more about detection and so many other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning of the moment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago.
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, who came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public spaces in public space.
And the question was, how can the technology, the new technology, to come to that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk>
It was believed as a <unk> water, with water.
If you fall in the middle, you can write to them, show you patterns, to show them patterns, right?
And at the end of the Cold War, it will open up to you as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor of <unk>
He liked a lot of it.
And <unk> a commission to design the building on the <unk>
We call it <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There are no doors or windows, but when you come up with it so you can make it happen.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there is a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk>
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, as in this case.
Those days there will always be somebody, in the winter, when the roof, when the roof, somebody who was there and he said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when you lower all the whole architecture of the brain.
Here is at work.
You see people <unk> so what's going on.
And here I'm myself in the way that I don't know when the sensors that open up the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors left out of it.
That night was actually even more interesting.
All of the children of <unk> came to the building because the way to interact was changed a little bit.
It was not a building that was going back to you, but a building that I kept doing and <unk> and black holes and you had to jump to <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, engineers, designers, we always think of the use of the use of our designs.
But then the reality is that it always works.
And that's the beauty of doing things to us.
This is a picture of the building with the physical <unk> the <unk> of the water, and of course on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
So imagine that those pixels were able to begin to start out.
Imagine you could have little helicopters on the air and that each one had a little bit of color that changes from color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one that we saw before, and it moves with other people.
We could form this cloud, and form this cloud, to form this cloud, and to form this cloud, and form this cloud, and form this cloud, and form this cloud, and form this cloud, and form this cloud, and form this cloud, and form this cloud, and form this cloud, and form this cloud, and form this cloud, and form this cloud, and form this cloud, and form this cloud,
And this sort of flexible screen like this with a normal array of <unk>
Or if in three dimensions, but in three dimensions, what it changes is light, not the position of <unk>
You can play with a different type of <unk>
So imagine that the screen would be in different scales and stay in different kinds of ways.
And then all of that could be a cloud of Nathaniel <unk> that you can get rid of and <unk> and see from very different places.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like this.
When the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by a person.
We can have each other. We can have each other? with an entrance that comes from people, and so on.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers in the 1970s, the star of New York and the <unk> of <unk> to capture their movements in 3D printing and use it as opposed to the <unk>
Here we can see <unk>
On the left you see the <unk>
It's so much, 3D on real time as it comes in.
You can see all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the <unk> we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the U.K.
It's called <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment -- like a <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> but with a <unk>
Imagine that we could make all of us a little bit <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we spend the last two decades, we go back the digital world.
We've got to think everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign has to go to the digital world -- we can go through the digital world, the power of networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use to design and make a <unk>
That means something built in a city.
But tomorrow may be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions from the digital world in the world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made out of the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of <unk>
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are fine.
It is a physical structure in London, but it covered a lot.
You can move around inside it.
You can see from the bottom, will serve to share the main moments of the Cold War and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So this is so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, like a new <unk>
You can get into it.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anyone who is going to be there.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I'd like to be better than that.
So let me tell you that, with just a few changes in their genes, they could improve the <unk> for a smaller <unk> and faster and faster and faster and faster.
Or maybe I would like to be in better form, to be more strong, have more <unk>
I would like to be more attractive and better for you.
What do we do more with more <unk>
Or maybe be of those people who always want to be more creative.
What is the most important thing to do?
What would you want to do, if you could choose it?
<unk> <unk>
How many people are <unk>
Raise your hand.
<unk> probably got the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you choose the <unk>
A few more. A few more.
And the not.
A little less.
What does that mean?
Oh, and that makes me feel very good as a doctor, as a doctor, as a doctor, as a doctor, and so on.
If you could have some of this that the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it is.
evolution has been a <unk> theme here, but today I want to give you a look at a doctor on the thing.
The vast majority of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which is also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote a essay called <unk> biology, has sense of the light of the <unk>
But if we effectively accept biological evolution, consider this: it's just the past, or the <unk>
It's about the other or to us.
This is another view of life.
The human part of this form, well in an extreme is, of course, the most important thing we have.
<unk> from a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
In contrast, there's been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here today.
It might seem that we are very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually in most the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like insulin dioxide, but it is the same protein, and it's the same protein, which is the <unk>
And by talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all have that we all have in the Amazon, more bacteria than the cells that we have in the rest of us.
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, you think -- when you think -- when you think about it, it raises the <unk> of the <unk> you think of the <unk>
The other one is a simple environment for those bacteria.
It's dark dark in it.
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that can be used without any effort from its way.
It is really how it goes fast for the bacteria to be able to get rid of some <unk>
But so we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest <unk> nutrients and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what does it mean?
We are in a evolutionary equilibrium as well.
Or to become something different, something that might be better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a short <unk> the animal kingdom as a single and only human life, a single <unk> and a little bit of a <unk>
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> of this talk -- so I hope that you have <unk>
When I just went back to college, I had my first class of biology.
I was fascinated by the dome.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and I realized something happened in the majority of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms that each cell simply is <unk> and all the genetic energy in that cell is embedded in the two cells.
But when the organisms that are <unk> things start to change.
It goes into the scene of <unk>
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual sexual insulin that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of the body is coming in evolution at the same time in the same time.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student who was thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death were pretty reasonable at the time, but with every year that was happening, every single year I had over the last 10 years.
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas well in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits his door.
he opens the door.
And he finds a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And he looks at it, and he says, <unk> you look at a <unk>
They said, "I said, "I love <unk> <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different purpose to the goal of the <unk> not necessarily <unk>
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to give you an example.
I wanted to reclaim my health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and more together.
Evolution is going to pass the genome to the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are kind of like <unk> designed to send the genetic burden to the next level of <unk> and then get to the sea.
I think that all of you have a feeling that I put on Allen Allen when he said, "I don't want to get the <unk> through my work.
I want to <unk>
The evolution doesn't necessarily exist.
It doesn't necessarily necessarily mean the biggest or the stronger or the stronger or the faster and the faster and even the <unk>
The evolution focuses on the best species in its environment.
That's the only thing to survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean of the ocean -- the bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish -- black holes were <unk> the <unk> yet they were able to do it in that way.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we come back to thinking about the place of humans in the evolution and in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> I would say there are many possibilities.
The first is that I don't know.
We have reached a second.
And the underlying value would be that by medicine, first of all, we have known that to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and killed from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so that they are being adapted to us as well as we get to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we <unk> so much that it's not possible to have the ability to have the ability to change the world.
A second possibility is that you get a evolution of the traditional kind of natural kind of <unk> forces of nature.
And the argument here would tell you that the <unk> of the evolution of the infinite evolution is <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when the species <unk> planets are going to exist in there and the environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third -- a third and a third one.
And I call <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could it happen?
How could we get to do this?
First really consider the reality that many people today, in some culture, are taking decisions about their <unk>
In some cultures, they are choosing more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society but what you choose to do at the individual level, and you choose the individual level of it.
Think of that if they could be able to choose not only sex from their <unk> but in their own body to do the genetic stuff.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reducing the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
They wouldn't want to do those changes in their own.
If we look at the future that kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project began in 1990, and killed 13 years ago.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a complete sequence of the 3,000 billion base pairs at a very close cost to close to the <unk> or in a week.
Not so much so that the human genome will actually make the human genome for <unk> and be more than at all.
They come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to engage with other diseases.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in course that with the vaccine against <unk> <unk> in the cells of a <unk>
You can imagine something good that you can do.
That's reality today and in the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine just another two little <unk>
You can change the cells of their bodies but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or changing the <unk> and give their children a better chance of a more chance of a healthy life -- eliminate diabetes -- to reduce the risk of <unk>
Who doesn't want to be <unk>
And then that same technology <unk> that same motor of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases of diseases that are going to allow us to take <unk>
Why don't we have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could <unk> with the next generation of <unk>
Why not have a muscle <unk> faster than allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't we live in <unk>
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in terms of the next generation and we can take the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100 years and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or their grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to get to them.
We're going to use these options to be able to take away from a better society.
Or, we're going to choose different attributes that we want for some of us but not for <unk>
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more <unk> and more <unk> and more <unk>
This is the kind of question that we're going to have to do.
And the most profound thing about it, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and the wisdom of the wisdom necessary to take these <unk> decisions.
For good or bad, and before what I could do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
So imagine a big explosion when you're to 900 feet away from you.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine doing <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a single seat that day.
It was the only thing I could talk to you.
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "We don't have a problem.
The pilot had already taken the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see it.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the <unk>
And that's not the case.
<unk> <unk>
Imagine being in an airplane and without <unk>
And then he said three words -- and then he said, <unk>
And the three words that have been <unk>
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the <unk>
And I was able to see it in your eyes, I was able to see it in your eyes, I was able to see it in your eyes, I was able to see it in your eyes, I was able to see it.
It was my life.
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a dream.
We have this list of things to do before we die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought all the people who wanted to get to get to come and I did not do it, all the experiences that I wanted to do, and I never did.
While I was thinking about that further, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the person is ready and the person is there, I'm going to show you how the person is there.
I don't want to <unk> anything in life.
And that leads to really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as <unk> the bridge George Washington -- which was not for a lot -- I thought about, "I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and with my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity I was also given to my son.
And I'm going to leave you with the time that I am not going to do things with people who don't know.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy from my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my voice.
It feels like <unk>
Now I'm not trying to have <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is because your mental clock is going to be <unk>
You see the water.
I'm saying, "Please get <unk>
I don't want it to be in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as a <unk> I had a sense of, you know.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for this whole whole life.
But it was very exciting.
I didn't want to <unk> my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in one thought -- which is, just like one thing.
I would like to see my children down.
A month later, I was in a school of my daughter -- first grade -- not a lot of art -- <unk> --  -- <unk> --  -- <unk> like a small one.
And to me, that was all of the reason for the world.
At that point I would argue by connecting those two points to the two points that all matter in my life is being a great father.
For everything, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
It was going to be taken off to me for a while.
And the other gift that was going on was the chance to look at the future and get back and live in another way.
You know, you are flying today, the challenge you imagine that the same thing happens on your plane -- and please please be -- but imagine -- and how do you <unk>
What is it that we still expect to do because they think they're going to live on the <unk>
How do you change your relationships and the negative energy in your life?
And most importantly, they're being the best parents that we have.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
It clearly has been <unk> in life with a lot of different projects.
But the most cool thing in which I worked was for this one.
The guy called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important things in the past.
One day came to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of it.
Today we have a lot of hope.
can only use your eyes.
His work on me.
I have a design firm and animation company, so obviously, compassion is something that you call and <unk> in the world of art.
So that's why we decided we were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and I met his brother and his father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I want to be able to talk with Tony <unk>
I just want to communicate with him and he will be able to communicate with him.
And I said, "A second, is not that you can see Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you are likely to be an important one, and you have a certain certain very good <unk> you can't actually do it.
These devices are not accessible to people.
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate that?
Could you see the movie <unk>
They communicate out of that stage, they get <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How can I do?
So I was presented with the only desire to deliver a walk and instead of that signed a walk that I didn't have the least idea of how it was going to be.
I was <unk> with his brother and his father there at that particular point, and this is the <unk> Tony <unk> he's going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to turn his art over time.
Because it's ridiculous that somebody who has so much inside the inside you can't see.
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who has a technology that allows them to project light on any surface and then with a laser scan of that and transfer the negative space on it.
So you go through the art facility as well.
All of the things that <unk> them are they say, they're part of a life cycle of life.
First of all, they start with sexual organs then with bad words, then with the attacks at Bush and at the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a cycle of life on their own.
And so on.
And about two years later, about a year later, about a year later, after a lot of time and a lot of the things on one side we had a couple of things.
One, we bring to the doors of medical companies and we get a machine so that we could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And, seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when I talk to the guy -- you get an email from him, and you say, "I don't know. This guy is <unk>
The other thing that we did was to bring seven programmers around the world <unk> from all the corners of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, and I moved back to the garage, and these hackers and these hackers and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> took control of the home.
A lot of our friends thought that we did something completely stupid and that when we were <unk> it would have taken off the walls of the walls and in their place.
But for two weeks <unk> we went to the <unk> <unk> my son was part of my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of <unk> sun, which we buy in the middle of the <unk> and some of the wire wire and things like <unk> and <unk>
We took a camera camera -- the <unk> -- this is a light light -- and now there's a device that is free that is free -- and it builds up -- we published the code <unk> the software <unk>
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no company that tells us.
There is no hospital that can tell us.
Any person with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using only your eyes, just your eyes.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Many thanks to you.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk>
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> for the great <unk>
And then over a year of planning two weeks of writing a few weeks of writing about all the night, Tony came back in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and is looking through the support system of his life.
He said, "You know, the bed I could see.
And we put a slide on a wall of the house.
And he came back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was on the street.
The funny thing that was funny was that we had to grow up in the parking parking lot so that we felt like we were in <unk>
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time that I was in seven years.
I felt like if I'd been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and I stood there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a certain way, that's our <unk>
That's what it keeps us on the ground.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a great device but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to <unk> and do it faster and better.
Since then, we've had all sorts of things.
We've won a lot of them.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
All of our own <unk>
Neither of them was <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, the magazine magazine conducted as one of the greatest invention of 2010, and it was really amazing.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up on the <unk> -- is that in April of this year in the <unk> of the <unk> in Los Angeles there is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of American art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you look at something that is not possible yet.
Nothing in this room was possible -- this was possible -- the computer, the <unk> -- the <unk> -- nothing was possible at a moment.
And then we <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not going to be able to do anything with this technology, but I just recognized something and I have been involved with some wonderful people to be able to do it.
And these are the questions that I want you all to all do every day when we find something that you have to do with something that you have to do. If it's not now, I'm not going to be here.
Thank you.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in situations usually very difficult and at the same time a long time.
I went to the <unk>
I worked in a mine of <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I spent 30 days eating only this fun at the beginning, something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end of the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I have been involved in situations in the situations in the situations with the only purpose of <unk> to explore social issues in ways that are <unk> -- and hopefully analyzing them in a way that you can see and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I was going to do a TEDTalk here about the world of <unk> and I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard of, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I got an email in <unk>
I told some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, some of the rights of the name of the name of my <unk>
What it was was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk -- my TEDTalk that you don't have to do with what it is and according to content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or to it.
But said that, it's a very good opportunity for us.
You know, how many people look at these <unk>
<unk> <unk>
It's a title in progress, by true.
So even with that <unk> I knew that somebody was going to buy the rights of me.
If you had asked me a year ago, I could not have been able to do it.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world of violence.
And as I said before, I have been in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> anything that I could <unk> for something so difficult or so dangerous as to go into the rooms with these <unk>
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that is about the <unk> of products, and of marketing and advertising, and that all the film was <unk> from products, marketing and <unk>
The film is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever, is that all up at the bottom, at first, it has images of brand, it's all about brand, all the way from the <unk> that appears before the title, the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> to the film to <unk>
And so the film explores all this idea.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
It was <unk>
But we're not just going to have the <unk> of the X <unk> in the title of the title but we're going to make sure that we can make sure that we can do all the categories that we can in the world.
You might be <unk> a shoe and it becomes the most cool shoe that you've done.
The most cool car you've ever done in "The largest film ever, I never know the best thing that you've ever seen before.
<unk> <unk> The idea is then to show you <unk> <unk> as part of the life, make it <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film was to do this whole thing.
You're going to see all the process in this film.
That's the whole idea that the whole thing is all about it.
And I would love to help you to help me do that.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it is the first time I hear it -- it's the most respect for the audience.
And yet, I don't know how to <unk> it's going to be the people at that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you <unk> -- but you know how it is going to be <unk> -- <unk> David <unk> How much money does you need to do this?
MS: A million and a half million <unk> <unk> <unk> I think it's going to be hard to do with them, but certainly it's going to be worth spreading.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie is going to look like a lot of <unk>
MS: What is going to be the <unk>
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be true.
MS: But it will be hard to get rid of <unk>
JK: All of things.
MS: means that you're not really a very <unk>
So I need to thank you.
MK: I can help.
MS: Very good.
MK: We need to think about what this is.
MS: Yeah. That is the <unk> When you look at the people that you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go.
MS: I thought that <unk> meant to have a conversation outside the <unk>
<unk> the camera means we don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one for one, all of these companies all together.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was struck by me.
They didn't want to know anything about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to translate the product to so many people as it was possible, so that so much people would see them as it was possible.
Especially in the world of today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the very strong means is not the idea that new health care vehicle is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I do.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> mistake and that mistake was it.
Actually, no, there was no such thing.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been fine.
But the problem was that it represents this image.
See, when you look at images of <unk> in Google <unk>                                                           
I like your way of <unk>
This was the problem: the <unk> <unk> of simulation or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> <unk> that is characterized by the visibility or the information of the information, especially in the practices of <unk> being the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our political <unk> the president <unk> even the <unk> even the <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make something happen.
But for what? Well, transparency day --  -- like that weird <unk> that still follows <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare way to work.
And it's also true.
What else does it mean?
<unk> a whole range of <unk>
That's really important.
When I started talking to the companies and I tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want to be <unk>
We want you to take a story, but that <unk>
See, when I was a kid, my father and my father told me in some lie -- and there is him as a single <unk> he said, <unk> there are three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's the story.
And you see, in this film I wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, an agency called me to help me, and that just because I met John Bond and Richard <unk> of a lot of it, I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take you in and go to companies with all my team.
So what I started to think of all of this suddenly -- and I started to get rid of me -- is that when you start talking with companies to understand your brand about your brand is a problem.
MS: So I have friends who do big films and big films and others who make small movies like that.
And my friends who make small Hollywood movies say that the reason why their movies have so success is because they have a lot of success that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how do we go to compete with these large, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film called "The largest film <unk>
How are we going to do specifically about <unk>
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say it was good for this <unk>
You're crazy. You see a little bit.
I want you to help you.
Maybe you should take a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there was one of these <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have its opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man like <unk> <unk> <unk>
That's the very beginning.
Now I can answer their questions and give you a look at it.
And we are a <unk>
It was the kind of small movies that <unk> we are more good at a <unk>
And so we don't have the budget that you have now.
So doing things like this, you know, <unk> to people is the reason why this is the reason that this is.
MS: What would you use to describe the <unk>
<unk> is <unk>
<unk> That's a big question.

MS: This is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talked about something else.
I think it's a great word that actually puts this category in positive category versus <unk> the smell and <unk>
It keeps you alive.
How do you keep you good <unk> with better <unk> with more <unk> <unk> three times more <unk>
Things like those who are <unk>
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What is there about that? What is there about a <unk>
I need to talk to the man from the street, to people like me, to the <unk>
They have to come up with me.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the bad guys.
Woman: I loved the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: Well, what is the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot like the colors, a lot of gray colors and things like this.
For most of you take me out of my <unk> or I like the crystals and the <unk> and the <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand <unk> you could be a <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand of <unk> I would call <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In a <unk> part of a <unk> partly <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 3: I'm the kind of <unk> I'm the <unk>
<unk> <unk>
So I guess that's my job.
In my small sector, that's my job.
Man 3: My brand is <unk> because it <unk> the <unk>
Man 3: <unk> <unk>
That's it.
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be able to go on, but often I will be <unk> at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized that I needed a problem.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, somebody who could help me understand what they call the <unk> of <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk>
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality of <unk>
If you could do it for them, you could probably do it for me.
<unk> <unk>
MS: Yes, the first picture is a picture of it.
So what happens when you ask a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings of it.
MS: These people use my way to see the world.
So let's start with that world.
MS: So I think your world is the world in which the world is in the world as the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work that you do to do it.
All of those things are <unk> and they start in a place and in my case and in my case, they start in my family.
So what is the next thing that you want to talk about?
MS: The next is the next day.
So how do we do this with your thoughts and feelings and your way to <unk>
MS: It's like who I want to be here.
I like things like this.
I like things that I like to say.
So what happens to the <unk>
What is the <unk> What is the <unk>
Why is it important to <unk>
And a little bit about that.
And a little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> you've <unk>
It doesn't have to be <unk>
MS: <unk> <unk>
So thank you for your <unk>
MS: Yes, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of help.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of different sides -- but <unk> on your personality of <unk> -- <unk> <unk> is a <unk>
They're <unk> very quickly.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies just have to be <unk> in one of their strong dots or on the other instead of focusing on it.
Many companies tend to -- and it's the nature of nature -- to avoid the things that are not <unk> -- but you really give them the fear, and you actually give them a sense of a positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are we do?
The first here is the case.
And you can also see here in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now there are a couple of examples, and you have access to those things that have gone and come up and come up and come up with a <unk>
MS: A <unk>
If somebody tells you that <unk> your identity makes your identity <unk> your <unk>
You're a <unk> <unk> You're somebody who makes your blood <unk>
Or are you more good for a <unk>
And a little bit more <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are like being used to be cool like the <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> or <unk> like <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> as <unk> as <unk>
Or are you more likely to <unk>
You're aware of as <unk>
You're <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're a little <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> like the Dalai Lama come up or <unk>
In the course of this movie we had over 500 companies, <unk> <unk> and <unk> they didn't want to form a part of this project.
They didn't want anything to do with this film, mostly because they wouldn't have control over the end of the end.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this film of how now we use synthetic MRI centers to identify the health centers in the brain in the brain for commercial marketing programs.
We went to San Paulo where they were forbidden in the air.
In the entire city for the last five years there are no <unk> no <unk> no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are getting way into schools in the United States with the U.S.
The incredible thing for me is that the projects that I've had the biggest answer or where I've had more success are those in which I've done it with things like this.
And that's what they did on this one.
<unk> to the <unk> they took their businesses, and they said maybe these workers don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly to the audience.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to make people think about people, which is going to challenge the world.
And how does it come from?
Well, since the film came out in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film came out in January, and since then, -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million hectares in the media for this time.
This takes just a period of two weeks and so.
That's just in <unk>
The movie is still <unk>
It's still on this. It's not in <unk>
It's not even done in other countries.
Ultimately, this film already has been <unk>
And it's not wrong because almost all of the agencies that we talk to you about to their customers won't be there.
I've always believed that if you were <unk> if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you take the people out of this <unk> it's <unk>
I think when you train their employees at the risk of being preparing to be preparing for all of their company to <unk>
I feel that what it has to happen to you is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, I think we have to give it to the fear.
We need to put that bear on a chip.
And <unk>
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately we have to pick up the <unk>
Now more than never a little bit of honesty today is going to go a long way.
And he said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk -- the <unk> -- has been brought by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> who for the name of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Many people.
June Cohen: So this is the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a technical question.
In my pocket I have a watch for the name of the TED, the <unk> Foundation -- a walk for <unk> to be applied to my laptop for TED in the year ...
And the idea behind the computer <unk>
We don't want Iran getting the nuclear power.
His biggest active to develop nuclear weapons, is the plant of <unk> <unk> in <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we were to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use software software -- they're a completely different technology.
But if we can put a computer health virus in a computer computer using this engineering box to set this crazy box then we are <unk>
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk>
The <unk> on the dark box is changing the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk>
It's easy.
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started thinking about <unk> about six months ago, the purpose was completely different.
The only thing that you knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of the <unk> the <unk>
It seemed like I wanted to do something with these <unk>
That was called the attention, and we started an experiment in which we <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So they were very different.
<unk> <unk> as a lab in the lab that I didn't like our <unk> it, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And then they were working with different flavors of <unk> I realized it, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack there.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking for to be able to do in the gray box if you find a specific event, and even if the program is trying to survive, it's actually working in that way.
If not, you can't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we don't know what the <unk>
It might be, say, for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
So what do we do?
So I went and <unk> and we discovered that I was <unk> on two <unk> and a little bit of a little bit and a big <unk>
We also saw that they were armed with people who were obviously had all the same data.
<unk> all of the points that I have.
You probably even know how much it is.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that the <unk> of <unk> is a complex and high technology, let me tell you the burden of it is very different.
It's very above all that we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this data.
We're talking about about 15 lines of data.
It looks pretty much like the old language.
I want to tell you how we were able to make sense to this question.
What we were looking at at the beginning was called <unk> <unk> because we know what they do.
And then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and we tried to <unk> with the real world of the real world.
We need theories about it that we can pass on or <unk>
So to get to the theories about that, remember that it's definitely a <unk> <unk> must be a <unk> <unk> and it's certainly where most of the treatment has been <unk>
You don't find several thousands of goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant and the <unk> plant is <unk> <unk>
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and plants between our <unk>
I called them and I think that I was in an effort to create their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to cut the little digital <unk> with the <unk>
And it is that particular part of the <unk> that black object that you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> you can certainly be <unk> and even make the <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and hurt in an obvious obvious obvious reason to go back to the Wright engineers so that they couldn't solve this fast.
And we tried to crack the digital <unk> by looking at very close to the data and their <unk>
So for example, the number of <unk> <unk> in that code, can't be <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what is called a <unk> and each resistance contains <unk>
That had a sense, there was a disease.
And it was a better thing.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called <unk>
And guess what we found in the <unk>
A pretty <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good one.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had between our hands.
And so there's no <unk>
So the results have been deployed after several weeks of work.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and we had to go back to <unk>
Even so, we found that both of these digital <unk> would take one and the same goal, but from different ways.
The little <unk> is taking a <unk> and making it turn the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
In <unk> we are very confident that we have a certain <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We don't need to worry that other goals are <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that are really interesting to me.
There is the graphic box and the top you see the <unk>
What this thing does is to intercept the values of sensors for example, for example, of blood sensors and <unk> sensors and provides a <unk> which is still running on the supply chain, with fake data, with fake data.
And believe it or not, this data data is <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera, the security camera is <unk>
It's great stuff.
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> to the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk>
We need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the big water steam engine goes on the speed, you have to open it up in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't make a human being.
And that's where we need global security.
And when you're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can be saved.
And the <unk> and the security system of the security system.
That's great.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is really important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It doesn't have anything to see, specifically with <unk> with <unk>
I could work as well, for example, in a energy plant, or in a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have to be <unk> to disseminate this burden with a <unk> <unk> as we saw in the case of <unk>
You can also use conventional technology for <unk>
<unk> the more possible.
And if you made that, with what <unk> is with a <unk>
That's the consequence that we need to do.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All green areas are spaces with large numbers.
We need to deal with this, and better we start doing it right now.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question. I have a question.
<unk> has been done in many sides of the side that the <unk> the <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
<unk> <unk> really want to listen to this.
Yeah. <unk> <unk>
My opinion is that the <unk> is involved but the engine is not <unk> but the engine is <unk>
And the engine behind this is the <unk>
There is one hand, and that's the United States, luckily, <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even worse.
CA: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give it to <unk> or another thing that I would make sure that I would hold it up and go back to school.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots <unk>
They're not anything different from something that gets in the morning, they give you a great strength, which is also going to increase its speed, and for example, for example, for example, to manage it.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate and shape it with the universe and with other things.
This is not an idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started to talk about the American soldier that, on average, it must take over his back a 45 pounds, and he's going to take it even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- <unk> in the back of the back -- in 30 years.
So we decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help us manage the thing.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> or <unk> <unk>
And with the exoskeleton -- I can <unk> 90 pounds per square meter per year.
Their flexible design allows you to put into <unk> <unk> and run up with big movements with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then where I want to go, and then I get my <unk>
<unk> <unk> We are up there, with our industrial mission to produce this device, this new <unk> this year, this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back now and look at the wheelchair users of what I'm talking about.
There are <unk> millions of people involved in concrete chairs around the world.
Like one percent of the population.
And this is a really interesting thing.
We talk about something that happens with often, very young people in the column that when you start their life -- at the age of 30 or 40 years -- or 40 or 40 years -- it turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population of the population.
His only option, many times -- for a brain injury or any other thing -- is the wheelchair with it.
And this has been so much for the last 500 years, from his successful <unk> as I should say.
So we decided to start to write a new chapter about it.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago had 19 years ago, had an injury in the <unk> column and as a result he couldn't go back for 19 years.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> who <unk> our <unk>
It's got a few sensors -- it's got a few sensors -- it's got a few sensors -- it's got a few sensors -- it's got a few sensors -- it's got a few sensors -- it's got a few sensors -- it's got a few sensors -- it's got a few sensors -- it's got a few sensors -- it's got a few sensors -- it's got a few
It's not going to be <unk> at the bottom, that they send signals to board, here in the <unk>
There are also a few batteries that give the motors into the motors in the <unk> and in the hands, and they make it move through this <unk> and so on.
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when, by a stranger and a stranger in the air, it costs me.
At a fraction of a second, I lost all of my sense and all of the <unk>
Shortly after that, a doctor came to my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> never you would never be able to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So let me tell you all the last little bit of my life on my own.
The adaptation of adaptation since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it down in <unk> flying rocks and even building up on the hand.
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to bring life to future future future generations -- not only from <unk> but to each other.
AB: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I just come back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have the <unk> they practice sex to tell them, and the game is the order of the day, where the fun is a serious thing.
And no, it's not the festival of <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, you know how to do that.
This is the world of the poor <unk>
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their lives more often.
That means that we all share a common narrative, a evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years.
Now chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done so much in this aspect of our human evolution of human evolution in our lives.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the game.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by large large, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special -- because this leads to a very tolerant society, where violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the less <unk> of the big <unk>
They live in the depths of the forest, and it has been very difficult for us.
The Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> stage that has been <unk> for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
It's not surprising that this destruction also puts the survival of the <unk>
<unk> meat trade and deforestation made that you can't fill in a stadium with the bonobos who stay in the world, and, honestly, we are not sure of it.
And yet, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear the <unk> <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know how the apes are <unk> the love, not the <unk> because they have sex with <unk> and <unk> to manage conflict and solve problems.
I'm not saying this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Jews, is more than the <unk>
At <unk> as humans, I love to play all over his life.
It's not just a <unk>
For us and for them the game is fundamental to establish socially and encourage the <unk>
With him we learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of <unk> diversity, diversity of <unk> diversity of data.
And when you look at the magic game, you see the roots <unk> all of you, the dance and the <unk>
The game is the <unk>
I don't know how you play -- but I want to show you a couple of just a couple of <unk>
First of all, it's a <unk> <unk> and I don't talk to you.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
So look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the moment, <unk> <unk>
And I just think that in this case to him to do it.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
So the sexual play is common in others.
And this video is really interesting because it <unk> this video really is really interesting because it shows the importance of bringing unusual elements to the game -- like <unk> -- and also how the game requires trust and breaking the <unk> and at the same time it's the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> you can take a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where you get <unk>
And I want to <unk> this is <unk> a young female female who is playing with water.
I think that as it were, sometimes we play them, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside our environment.
And this is that strange curiosity that drives us to show us how it takes us and then the unexpected connections that are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that the Taliban give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a more difficult world, more difficult to more and more <unk>
The secret is that the game is the key to the <unk>
In other words, the game is our <unk>
To adapt to a success of a world that changes us.
But, you know, at the cost of the <unk>
The game is not <unk>
The game is important.
For <unk> and human life, life is not just <unk> and <unk>
When it seems to be appropriate to play, you can be the moments that it is the most <unk>
So of course primates, we are doing this gift of evolution and play together as <unk> creativity, gender and <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called subclinical <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> in a <unk> body <unk>
And in our city, where volunteers are leading to a highly specialized personal staff -- you have to get to the site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first one.
I was the second volunteer at the site, so I had a pretty high probability of play.
But still there was a race to foot on the other volunteers to get to the captain to charge and figure out what it was our job.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the fact that certainly one of the worst days of his life.
We were at night at night, she was standing outside the rain, under a <unk> in <unk> while his house was on it.
The other volunteer that I had just got to come before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  -- it was first to Captain and he asked him to go to the dog <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk>
There was a lawyer or a lawyer who was a lawyer who during the rest of his life, would have to tell the people that I walked into a <unk> building to save a live <unk> just because I won for five years.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain did a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to <unk>
I need to give you a <unk> <unk> and I'll give you a couple of examples.
What happens?
It wasn't exactly what I was expected to do, but I got the stairs, at the end of the room, at the end of the room, I went to the North Pole.
And I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a scientist.
I took my load away from the staircase where I met my <unk> and the crazy dog in the door of the <unk>
<unk> from the house to the house <unk> where, as it was in <unk> his <unk> got a lot more attention than me.
A few weeks later the department got a letter from the <unk> <unk> <unk> by the brave American effort to save his home.
And the way she looked at it was that she looked at the other was that somebody had reached a couple of days.
So both in my <unk> in general? I like my <unk> as well."
And you know what I did.
Everything has its own.
So when I look at this room to people that have been done, or are in <unk> levels of success I would like to remind you of this.
Don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in your life.
If you have something to play.
<unk> food in a <unk> <unk> a <unk> park in <unk>
And they are <unk>
Not every day we are going to have the opportunity to save the life of someone but every day we are going to be able to influence life.
So you get to the <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Yeah.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
And this may seem strange, but I'm a great <unk>
The first concrete blocks put in <unk> with a very simple idea is a very simple idea that they fit together to fit together.
Very quickly, these became the largest building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build more big things that we, as buildings or violence, a <unk>
So essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1994, the <unk> came up with this.
He was called <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> <unk> came to all of us.
It's estimated that they've been done over 400 billion or 75 feet per person on the planet.
You don't have to be engineer to build beautiful buildings or whatever.
<unk> did it.
<unk> simply led the particular block of concrete, the favorite <unk> in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, the same year, in the same year, the next year, the next revolution was about <unk> the new block of <unk>
The transistor was a little plastic unit that would take us from a <unk> world to make them a little bit more on others to a world where everything was possible.
Just like the third, the transistor is able to create much larger and more complex circuits in the time.
But there is a <unk> difference in the case.
I personally don't really know what the building blocks of our time are getting to the experts, so I decided to do it.
Two years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of taking the power of the engineers to the hands of artists and girls.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how to work.
<unk> are hired every single one with a daily function as well.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about the whole is that you can.
So you can't get it.
<unk> have a code of things.
The green is the blue one, the blue is the stream, the pink <unk> is the entrance and the orange one.
So you just have to put one blue with one green and very quickly and very quickly, you can start doing this.
A blue with one green one.
We can put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
So if we change the button by the way, that is here, and now we have a <unk>
<unk> this is going to make a lot more impact and we have a computer machine there.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game -- <unk> are actually really interesting.
Instead of having to do it, connect and <unk> it allows us to program using a very simple <unk>
In order to make <unk> faster or faster you can just move this button that makes the pulse faster or more <unk>
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a collection of <unk>
We want all of the interactions in the world to get rid of <unk>
<unk> sounds like solar cells.
We have given them <unk> kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you can't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light light night, or why the door of an elevator gets open or how a iPod responds to the <unk>
We've also taken it to art schools.
So for example, designers without experience in electronics start to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk>
<unk>  A few weeks ago, we took a few weeks to the designers at the University of Rhode Island, and they don't have any experience in engineering, just in Stockholm and paper and we said, "I don't know something.
So here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk>
But I was doing this here at my time.
It is a <unk> made out of cinema that has fear of it.
For those of these engineers, people were not <unk> in another material, the electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be at all.
And so forth.
You can visit the page, download all of the design of design and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of inventors, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this world we live in.
And so on.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk today about the beginning.
I work in the solar system.
And my little company is looking at the environment.
based on the Internet.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> <unk>
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue to keep the video on one side to one side to one side.
No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.
This is not ...
Very good.
The solar technology is -- solar technology is -- solar technology is ...
Oh, I'm going to give you a <unk>
OK. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technical questions for you to take a year and work in an environment that is almost everything that is supposed to be, and we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a couple of <unk>
And so some members each year and we put them on the <unk>
Instead of getting rid of the Third World world we send the <unk>
They had big <unk> worked with the employees <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
And it's a little bit.
Here it shows you as if you would go to a date, but what you really look for is that somebody else is trapped in the snow when it comes to snow because it knows that it's not very good <unk> when it's covered by an emergency room.
How did it come to help the help of this <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of <unk> <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time, and at that time, I was a much last year.
They realized that the city never <unk> these <unk>
But one of the members of the magazine called Erik <unk> noticed something more than the citizens <unk> with <unk> <unk> right in front of them.
And so he did like any of a sudden I developed a <unk>
It's an app that you can take for a <unk>
You know?
When you do that, you put a name, in this case you put <unk>
If you don't do it.
I mean, it has a solution.
It's an app for it.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications of <unk>
But it does something that no one else in the U.S.
And it is <unk>
A responsible part of the city of the city of <unk> when you see this app realized that I could use it not for the snow, but so the citizens would get <unk> of <unk>
It's very important to work with these <unk> of tsunami, but people are <unk>
So that's why we asked citizens that <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago has just gone from <unk> to make people <unk> to clean up.
So we now know nine cities that are <unk>
And this has been <unk> in a <unk> way of organic <unk>
If you know a little bit of government technology, you will know that this is not going to happen.
So the dynamics of software are usually a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two months and a half years.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that they had been done by normal channels would have taken at least two years and over two million dollars.
And that's not all.
Now there's a project in the court power of California that until the time has gone down 2,000 million dollars and not works.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that shows you in a couple of days, and it's <unk> it is a kind of throw away from the institution to the institution of government.
It turns out the best way to work with the best ways of working not as business as a lot of people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but more like the Internet.
That is to say, <unk> in the open shape.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way the government to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of a <unk>
And that's very good because it turns out we're very good for collective action with the digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that they are building together.
And it's not just <unk> for example, but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> applications -- every day in their own communities.
They have not been given to us.
They get a big frustration with that but not <unk> it was <unk>
And these people know something that we have lost from it.
And it is that if we stop the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that make us crazy -- the government is essentially the words of Tim <unk> who we do together because we don't have <unk>
Now a lot of people have been involved in government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it because things are changing. Because things are changing.
The politics doesn't work.
And because the government ultimately gets rid of that -- remember that of the <unk> the <unk> the way to make change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to choose to <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is about all of us.
This is the heart of health care and information.
It's the place that serves the calls if you take <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this <unk>
I got <unk> at the base of <unk>
I didn't find anything with it.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put it very strong and see if you were <unk>
And so on. So for example.
But that's not the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a plan.
It has a <unk> web and mobile phone.
We don't know.
It was the work of very smart people from the United States of New York City.
One day, this was actually this <unk> <unk> on my checklist -- I don't know if it's <unk>
How do I do to <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking to person.
In <unk> <unk> all of this is so much, so you can all see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
And the next report said, "I went back to place, I found the cube garbage behind the <unk>
Yeah.
I said, <unk> I went home.
Good afternoon.
<unk> <unk>
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical things.
And it's also a great example of the government of the government of the government of the government of the government of the government of the government in history.
But it's also a great example of government as a result.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of <unk>
I'm talking about a platform so that people are <unk> and help others.
So a citizen helped another but right here the government had a <unk>
I went to the two people.
And it could be connected with the government services to be necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and more cheap and cheaper and more cheap than that.
When one neighbor helps another neighbor to another.
If we call control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing that we need to think about is that it's not the same as the politics.
A lot of people do it, but think that one is the entrance of the other.
That our entrance to the government is the answer.
How many times have they chosen a <unk> leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government <unk> our values and <unk> our needs but then we don't see it in a <unk>
That's because the government is like a huge ocean, and politics is the <unk> layer of 15 <unk>
That's what's called <unk>
And we say that word <unk>
But it's that <unk> which is what it takes to us that we call it as a thing that happens in our own language, that other thing, and at least we are losing the power.
People believe that politics is <unk>
If we want this institution to work, we will have to have to do the same.
Because this is where the real impact of government.
We need to collaborate with the government.
That does it.
They have <unk>
It's a group of citizens who have written up a very detailed report of <unk> pages in response to the answer to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
That is not a political activism that is <unk>
And so that we have been <unk> in the government, is time we ask ourselves what we want to do to our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to do.
They really believe that we have to go to the institution of the institution that can be used in behalf of us.
We can't do it for government, we need to be more connected.
The good news is that with the technology is possible to rethink the root function of the government so that it can lead to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to act <unk> there is only to articulate the systems of the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years so that I, in <unk> I'm a greater generation that many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and making it almost entirely for us.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to be <unk>
You can express your opinions at any same time.
So when we face the problem of the government doesn't matter much to be able to hear their own lives.
They're using hands.
And so my hands on the work to program applications that do better work better in government.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be done by a <unk> <unk> taking a bucket of garbage that has a <unk>
And of course, we could be able to get those <unk> and a lot of people did.
But these applications are kind of like digital <unk> that we're not only citizens, we are not only consumers of government that pay taxes and we get services.
We're more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get <unk>
So I want to ask all of you, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, we all have to do together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will be a crowd of <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
This is for me.
I've spent most of the time in cousins in L.A. and at the age of death.
I've spent most of my life in the early communities and places where there is a lot of space.
And I will be here at TED watching and hearing these pollutants have given me a lot of energy.
One of the things that I've noticed in this short time, is that TED is that TED has it.
And the things that they say here is the impact on the world.
Instead, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that doesn't have a sense that it doesn't have to be another way.
I say this because I think your identity is <unk>
So here we go.
And I think we've learned that the words of a professor can have a lot of sense, but if you teach it, you can have a special meaning, you can have a special meaning, you can have a special meaning, you can have a special choice.
A doctor can do good things -- <unk> if it's <unk> it can do much more.
So I want to talk about the power of it.
I actually didn't really do this in the right practice of the right practice on the right, my work.
I learned from my own.
I grew up in a traditional house of an <unk> family <unk> by a <unk> who was my <unk>
It was a strong one.
It was the last word in the entire family.
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter, <unk>
Their parents were born in slavery in South Africa.
She was born on <unk> and his experience with slavery -- the way I saw the world.
She was a while, but it was also <unk>
When I was small and I looked at it, she came up to me and gave me a good idea.
I would like to <unk> so strong that I could barely afford it.
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> and said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if he was telling me no, no, he was <unk> and if he told me that yes, I would give me to peace.
I had this human quality that I would always want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the best.
Instead, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture his time and his attention.
My cousins were running around all over the world.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up a morning, I woke up a morning, I went to the room and they were running all my time.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and I looked at me.
At first, I thought it was a game that I thought was a game game.
So I looked at it, and she looked at it, but she was very happy.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she went down around the room, I took my hand and said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I remember this as if I was one.
I never did.
It took me outside and said, <unk> you will tell you something, but you can't say to <unk>
I said, "Yes, <unk>
She said, "The <unk> <unk> that I don't know.
And then I realized, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk>
He said, "I believe you can do what you can do.
I never did.
And then he said, "I'm <unk> I want to take you three things.
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want to talk to you about is that you always want to read your <unk>
And I said, "I am my <unk> and you have to <unk> that I will always be <unk>
As I said, my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk>
And then he said, "I'm a second that I want to talk to you, is that I'm always going to do the right although the right thing is <unk>
I thought I said, "Yes, <unk>
And then he finally said, "What I want to talk to you about, is that we never have <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk>
I grew up in the field, in South Africa, and I have an older brother and sister a year later.
When I was 14 or 15, my brother came home to house with a six <unk> I don't know where the <unk> got us to my sister and I went to the forest.
We just got the <unk>
He took a joke from he was offered my sister, she took a little bit and he was offered to me.
I said, "No, no, no, no, no, no, I'm not <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today, I want you to do the same thing. And you always do the same thing.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, <unk> I don't feel good.
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's going on?
I showed you a little bit of <unk> and <unk> <unk> not being that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you doing?"
He said, <unk> it tells you all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't be.
I know that this is <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this is a <unk> I say that it's a <unk> I say to the power that has its own.
When we created the right kind of identity, we say things to other people who don't really look like this.
We can't get to do things that don't believe us.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all their grandchildren were right.
My grandfather had been raped during the <unk>
My wife died of diseases of diseases like this.
And these were the things that I like that, as it was, it was the things that, according to it.
Now, trying to talk about our justice system.
This country is very different from what it was about 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 100,000 people.
There are a couple today.
In the United States we have the largest population in the world.
We have seven million people in the world.
And this blindness is <unk> in my mind, has changed our world.
In poor communities or black, it finds so much <unk> so much of these things.
One of three black holes between 18 and 30 years is in prison or in prison in prison,
In the urban <unk> around the country, Los Angeles Philadelphia, Philadelphia, and I Philadelphia, by 50 to 60 percent of all the young people in jail or at the same time.
So our system is not just an easy way in front of race, right?
In this country we have a court system that is much better if you are rich and whether, if you're poor and <unk>
It's not <unk> but wealth is what the results are.
And it seems to us that we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and the <unk> make us believe that these are not natural issues.
We are <unk>
It looks like this.
We're looking at our work in our work with some good things.
In my state, in Alabama, -- as in other states, as in other states, if you have a rights for me -- if you have an idea.
Now in Alabama, in Alabama, the <unk> of black people have lost the right to get the right to look at it.
And if we're showing it over the next 10 years the loss of rights will be as high as it was before it was the first time that we were going to be able to do it.
We have this awesome thing.
I am a <unk>
Many of my customers are very different.
The United States is the only country in the world where we were <unk> to die at night.
We have in this country jail for children, no chance of coming out of it.
Right now we're in a process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people at the age of death.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, you've got to think that the end question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
a very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we're in our life.
There's another way of <unk> it is not to decide whether people deserve to die for crimes -- but if we do it.
This is interesting.
The death row in America is defined by this.
In every nine people, <unk> has identified one that is innocent that it is <unk> and 95 percent reduction of death.
A <unk> rate of <unk> <unk> an innocent innocent person.
This is interesting.
In retrospect, it would not allow you to ever be able to read if every nine that <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we have <unk>
It's not our problem.
It's not our way.
It's not our own.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if you will.
It is interesting that in my classes with students on history -- I'm talking about <unk>
And I'm talking about the time that the time it started at the end of the reconstruction of the reconstruction of the Second World War.
I don't know a lot about this.
But for the American Americans in this country, it was a period of time.
In many communities people had fear of being <unk>
I was worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what its lives.
Now there are more people who come to me, and they say, "Mr. Gates, you know, you know, <unk> <unk> <unk> to the people who stop saying that in our history we deal for the first time in our history.
I'm going to ask you to tell me that you grew up.
The era of terrorism was obviously with the <unk> and decades of <unk> and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic because we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we have done.
All of the time <unk> one with each other.
We are creating tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about <unk> I think it's because we are not willing to engage with a real truth and how it works.
In South Africa, people understood that they could not be able to overcome the <unk> <unk> without a commitment to the truth and the environment.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany working on the death penalty story.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said, "You know, it's okay to listen to what you <unk>
<unk> we don't have death penalty <unk>
<unk> will never be there.
The room was in silence and a lady said, "We don't have a way that with our story, we can never get to be able to get to the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we, a lot of us, and we have to put us into a <unk>
<unk> about this.
How do we go in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their most <unk>
We couldn't do it.
It would be true.
And yet, there is this problem.
I think our identity is in China.
If we really don't care about these difficult issues, the positive things and wonderful things are <unk>
We love innovation.
We're fascinated by technology.
We love the entertainment.
But then after those realities are <unk> by suffering, the abuse, the <unk> the <unk>
In my opinion, we need to integrate both things.
We talked about the need to talk about the need to have more hope, more hope, more procedures with the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that it means to spend more time thinking about and talking about the poor, the <unk> who will never come to TED.
So thinking about them in some way, something that is within our be.
It's really that we have to believe that we have no idea.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so engaged with the intellectual <unk>
So with innovation, with creativity comes not only from human ideas.
These things are coming from ideas from <unk>
This connection in the mind is what drives us to look at what drives us not just in the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and well.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in Europe and suffering the <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation, for the spirit, a will to be in places like this.
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think still in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There is no disconnect between technology and design, that allowed us to be truly human, if we don't pay attention to poverty, to poverty, to the inequality, to the extent to the Internet.
Now I want to show you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we choose these things.
And it was going to happen.
I had the great privilege to be a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were able to just talk to you.
Occasionally, she was called me to say, <unk> <unk> comes the lady <unk> and we're going to bring us back to speak to us.
Do you want to come and do <unk>
I said, "I know what? I know what?
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I was <unk>
So I was just and just <unk>
It was a very <unk>
And in one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, 9/11 came to me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk> that is that idea of <unk>
So what you're trying to do is do what you're trying to do.
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question it.
We tried to help those who have been <unk>
And we tried to confront the <unk> and the discrimination in the administration of the <unk>
And we tried to end up with <unk> <unk> for the kids.
We tried to do something about death.
We're trying to reduce the population into the atmosphere.
We tried to end up with the <unk>
I gave all my best speech, and at the end of me, I looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> was <unk> he put me finger on the face and said, "It's so that you have to be very good but <unk>
I think that actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to deal with those issues, those problems, that happen.
Because ultimately, the humanity depends on compassion for us.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been a little bit <unk>
I've come to understand and to believe that every one of us is top of the worst thing we have done.
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says one -- it's not because it's a <unk>
I'm sure if somebody takes something that doesn't exist, it's not that it's a <unk>
If someone kills each other, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> for the future.
I also think that in many parts of this country and, certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the future.
It's not.
And I really think that in many parts of poverty is the justice.
And finally, I think even though it is very beautiful, very beautiful, very beautiful, <unk> <unk> we don't judge our technology, because our designs, not our intellectual ability or ourselves.
At the end of a society, the character of a society, not because of the way they deal with the rich and <unk> but by the way they deal with the poor, the <unk>
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues, about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much.
<unk> <unk>
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a way.
I've been talking about these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients 13 and 14 years old, which have been <unk> so that they were <unk>
And I start thinking, how can I be?
How can a judge to turn someone into what we don't know.
The judge would be as an adult, but I see a child.
One night after I was asleep <unk> for God, if the judge can turn it into something that you don't are, it must have been <unk>
Yes, <unk> the judge has to be <unk>
You can do something about it.
As it was very late, I could not think right, but I started working on a <unk>
She had 14 years of 14 years old, a small <unk>
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my customer <unk> to be treated like a white <unk> of 75 years of a <unk>
In the <unk> I put that there there had been behavior behavior in the <unk> of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how this country is there -- but a whole range of automobiles.
On the next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> would be a dream, or really the <unk>
For me, I didn't just have the <unk> but I had the <unk>
It was about two months old.
And he finally <unk> his God, I have to go to the court for this case there.
I got to the car and I really felt <unk>
I went into the car to make it in the hospital.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally came back from the car.
I was going down the stairs when I found out with a black man <unk> was the <unk> of <unk>
When I looked at me and said, "I'm going to tell you this is <unk>
I said, "I am a <unk> he said, "It's you <unk>
And so I came up with a <unk>
And I was stuck in the ear, and I was stuck in.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that it was <unk>
And that makes me deeply obsessed with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went to the lab.
By coming in, the judge saw me.
And he said to me, "Look, there you have this <unk>
I said, "I went <unk> and we started <unk>
People started to go.
I was one of those <unk>
I got the cops to the <unk>
Anyway, without knowing how, the room was full of people, and all of us, because we were trying to learn from poverty, because we were talking about poverty, because we were talking about poverty.
With the eye of the eye I got to see the <unk> that I was and <unk>
I was going to go through the window and I would hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking here and there.
And finally, this old black face with <unk> came in the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of <unk>
About 10 minutes later, the judge was <unk> a <unk>
And over the course of a <unk> <unk> he showed it because the <unk> had in the room.
The <unk> <unk> <unk>
And he said, "Well, what do you do in the <unk>
And the old black stood up, looked at the <unk> I looked at me and said, <unk> in this room in order to tell this young person who would get their view on the target with <unk>
I have come to TED because I think many of you understand that a lot of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big -- but that will affect the justice.
We can't really be truly human if we don't care about human rights, and for the sake of <unk>
That our survival is attached to each other.
That our visions of technology, design and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> of <unk>
And above all, those of you here who share this, I just want to tell you that they will keep the view in the target with <unk>
Many thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Chris Anderson: Thank you for hearing and see a good desire in the audience, of this community, of this community, to help you do something.
It's something that is not a <unk>
<unk> There are several opportunities there.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which it's going to make a effort to <unk> the funds that they spend in the future.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row in the next five years. One billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of Christmas, not <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't get to nothing.
Here's an opportunity of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that it is going to happen, these funds to make the law, to help the security of the security.
I think there is a very good opportunity to do.
CA: There have been a huge decline in the <unk> in the United States in the last three decades.
Now part of the question is that you have to do with the greatest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who believe that is it?
<unk> Actually, the rate of violence has been relatively simple.
The big growth in massive <unk> in this country is not for violence.
It's about the wrong war against it.
So that's why this dramatic increase in the population.
And we left us by the edge.
We have three legal causes to bring people into <unk> <unk> to rob a bicycle with small crimes against ownership, instead of making them <unk> those resources to their lives.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of the <unk>
It seems to me that our current philosophy of fear is not done yet.
I think that's the orientation he has to change.
CA: <unk> you've got a <unk> right now.
You're very depressed.
Many thanks for TED. Thank you.
They were <unk> the threats of <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
A few years ago, I went to the <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Oh, God bless you.
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months, <unk> could be in the last six days or over the last six years.
So the idea is that media media means <unk> news because our minds are paid attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of every single day of our senses, our senses are still more data than probably the brain may be.
And as nothing tells us that they will survive, the first standing standing on all of those data is an old clip of the temporal lobe called <unk>
And the amygdala is our original shape.
<unk> and what all of the information is looking for something in the environment that could make it happen.
And so of course a <unk> stories of <unk>
That old saying from <unk> "If there is blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all the digital devices give us negative news about the seven days of a week, 24 hours a day, it's not wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to happen in worse in worse.
But maybe not that.
Maybe instead of change, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the huge progress done in the last century for a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance over the next three decades.
I'm not saying we don't have our good <unk> climate change, the extinction of the species, the water shortage and the <unk> of the <unk>
As humans, we are very good at <unk> the problems and, at the long time with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average life has been more than the average income per capita income per capita per capita per capita in the world.
child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, from the electricity, of transportation and communications, has taken off 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living in the most peaceful time of humanity.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy country has spent over 80 percent in the last 130 years.
we're really living in a moment.
<unk> <unk>
And we continue to continue to <unk>
In fact, <unk>
<unk> today in the U.S., much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, they have electricity, mobile phones, air conditioning and <unk>
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the last century, the <unk> of the planet, would never have ever been there with such <unk>
<unk> a lot of this is the technology and then then then the <unk>
My good friend Bob Kelly showed that any tool that was <unk> in technology -- the information jumps on this curve, the Moore's Law Moore's Law Act and double the price of about 12 to 24 months.
For that reason, the mobile phone you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the years ago.
Now look at this screen.
It's the Moore's Law Act for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this screen.
First, how soft that is -- in good and bad time -- in the war and in peace, in the war in depression and <unk>
It's the bottom of computers that are used to build a lot more money.
He didn't stop at any of the big part.
And even though it's <unk> in a law to the left, it goes up.
The growth rate of technology is in every single time.
And in this curve, at least of Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we're doing today.
The computer in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call this computing computing and networks, space and the robotics, 3D printing and its ability to democratize and distribute materials around the planet, and the digital biology and food and food and food and food and food and food and food and food and food and food and food and food and food and food and food and food and
I mean, how many of you saw the victory at <unk>
It was incredible.
I looked in the newspapers the best <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Not a lot.
And this is what the human language is.
Imagine this artificial intelligence on the cloud, available for all of the cell phone.
Four years ago here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and, in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them a company, or a product or service or service that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have been <unk>
We can actually point out a <unk> of companies that have already done this.
When I think about it, we don't really mean to create <unk> life for each other. It's about creating a life of what we do.
It is about taking that that it is <unk> and <unk>
You see, <unk> is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you a example.
It is a story of Erik <unk>
He's the kind of <unk>
<unk> <unk> The king of <unk>
And the troops were born with <unk> <unk> and the same <unk> with <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate <unk>
You see, oil was the most valuable metal of the planet, it was more than the gold and the <unk>
For that reason, the tip of the iceberg.
You see, even though it is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like this.
It's attached to the oxygen and the <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made it so cheap that we used it as if it were <unk>
And <unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about the energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet -- for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year year.
It took the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every day.
It's not going to be.
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the <unk> of <unk> <unk>
The cost of solar energy was 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the United States parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents per hour compared to the top 15 cents in the U.S.
And if we have abundance of energy from the water.
So what about the <unk>
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed to the Hubble Space Telescope to the Earth, in 1990, when I spent <unk>
<unk> a picture of <unk>
"A <unk>
Because we live in a water.
We live on a planet in 70 percent.
Yes, the <unk> water is water, two percent is ice, and they have been <unk> by the <unk> of the planet, but also here is a hope.
It's a technology that's available for 10 or 20 years now.
And it comes from technology.
In a conversation with Dean -- this morning, one of the innovators from the <unk> I would like to share with you, gave me permission to take care of him -- his technology called <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a <unk>
It is able to generate a thousand gallons of drinking water to the day of any source source -- water, water -- a <unk> for less than two cents a day.
The president of Coke just comes out of this, which will make a major test test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes well, and I have very sure and I have no confidence that it will be, you would be diving in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation for this technology that we have.
And we've seen it.
God is going to get to 70 percent of the mobile phones in the developing world for the end of the year.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that President Obama does 25 years ago.
And, of course, with a smart mobile phone with the more knowledge and information that President Clinton done 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of the abundance of information and communications that no one could ever have.
And so the things that you know, the things that you and I have paid for tens of thousands of dollars -- video video -- video video games and music, science and music, technology is now <unk> and lose value value with the <unk>
Perhaps the best way to get it is to get to the future.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation -- something called the X <unk> <unk> of 10 million dollars.
We're focusing on the world teams so that we have these technologies in a mobile device with which they are, and because they have <unk> they can <unk> you can take blood in your body.
So to win it has to make better decisions.
Imagine this device in the middle of the world in which there are no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent of the health care workers in health.
When this device made a <unk> virus or a DNA virus that I can't call to be calling to the health of health care and, first of all, it will be the case.
But this is the biggest force of making a world of <unk>
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
So we have to move the brand from seven billion dollars.
By the way, the best protection against the demographic explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, right?
To try to move from two billion to five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion of the minds have never been able to have never seen before.
What would these people?
What do we do? What does it mean?
And instead of an economic collapse we will have the biggest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Academy Academy and because of the use of 3D printing, and the computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we take 3,000 millions of members of humanity, healthy <unk> and <unk>
What would we never do before <unk>
What if we give them all the together, wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and be able to act for the first time?
What do we <unk>
And if they are contributions that we can't see.
One thing that I learned with the X X is that small teams are little, for its passion with an example of one of those of us -- you can do things that before you could only do the big corporations and education.
I'm going to finish by sharing a story that I really did.
There's a program that maybe some of you already know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, D.C.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out the way that you get rid of it.
The premise says, <unk> and <unk>
It's a very important thing.
And so far, it was a <unk> problem.
They've played with this research.
Then hundreds of thousands of people stood up and started <unk>
And it has been shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better to make the kinds of proteins that the best language.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge trust in the future is that today we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this technology.
We have the passionate <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have 3,000 million new minds that are <unk> to work on the solution of big challenges and doing what we should do.
We have for a few decades.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk>
The <unk> of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before you give them three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my favorites.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't that.
<unk> fish.
And he described one of them as a very <unk>
It was the <unk>
It took it long until the decade of <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about the Galapagos and other places, so it doesn't have any special <unk>
But the case is that we still come to the lab.
We still think they're <unk>
And yet, they still say they are still <unk>
So what happened?
And the second story, also in the context of the <unk>
Because I was there in <unk> studying a waterfall.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be true.
I made a lot of me with the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
And he was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from a few <unk>
There were <unk> about 20 percent of the <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and passed for a good moment, so it was done over the middle of the day.
When I was there 27 years after the fish had gone down to half.
<unk> at the age of five.
<unk> a lot of <unk>
There was still no fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but it's all been changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1980s, <unk> started in the <unk> Europe and many developing countries.
The developing world was brought to the countries that they already had 100,000 <unk>
And this little little little bit like the <unk>
I came up with it, and we were working on the south of the South Africa of China and over everything in the <unk> Sea <unk>
And what we did was it was something that we did.
<unk> now the bottom of the sea.
Because 90 percent of what we were doing, were <unk> other animals that are in the <unk>
And most of the fish are red red on a few <unk> remains that they are fish of <unk>
In summary, the sea came to the roof and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very simple.
In a year, you get a study and then you start fishing in a year.
The bottom line is to be a solid magnetic field in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk>
Not <unk> <unk> because they were <unk>
And once we take a look.
It still wasn't <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains of what we collected every time they go to an area where they have never been there.
But it's not.
<unk> the world, but we don't know.
<unk> the point of starting to start to remember what was there.
If you look at this happens something else.
On the axis here, and we have a lot of <unk> biodiversity, much of the country, the water supply of water.
And that changes with time because people are doing things with <unk>
Every generation is using images to use the beginning of its conscious life as normal and extrapolate towards us.
The difference is that you perceive the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of itself.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at it.
And at the end of the day.
And that, in a great example.
We want to keep things they don't are, or they're not what they were doing.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies are killing animals without knowing what they have done to each other.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very encouraging.
You can't lose it.
You lose animals.
Even if this doesn't feel like a great idea.
With the time, we really focused on the big animals, and in a certain sea of big fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
With the time you get a few fish -- but we think that's the point of view.
And the question is: why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know that it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> who were very different.
And what do you do because the evidence led in a earlier way, is not in the way that they would expect to have the <unk>
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> as a teenager, as a captain and a young fish in this area cannot be used or, usually they do not use the scientists to protect them because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, but we lived in societies <unk> because they don't trust the sources of the past.
From there the huge role that can be turned into a marine area.
Because with the marine protected area. I really need the past.
<unk> the past that people can't afford because the point of play has been running and it's extremely powerful.
That's for the people that you can see a protected area and they can benefit from the vision that <unk> which allows them to erase their point of view.
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the Middle East.
I think that there is the arts and film maybe you can fill the vacuum.
This is a simulation of <unk>
A long time ago, there were brown whales in the <unk>
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about it, if you think about it, if you think about what people are doing with the movie <unk> talk about the story of <unk>
Because it changes something that, in a sense, has been lost.
And so my goal -- the only thing that is going to be is that it is true, making <unk> under the water.
Many thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the manager of <unk> <unk> and I look at YouTube videos in <unk> <unk>
It's true.
And so now we will see why videos are made up and how important it is.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> when I was younger, that looked like something very, very hard.
But today the video makes any of us, or from our actions, we have been involved in a part of our global culture.
Any one can be famous on the Internet in a <unk>
You get over 48 hours of video video on YouTube for minute.
And, of course, just a small percentage of it makes sense. They have a lot of visits to each other.
How do we do that?
Three things: creators of <unk> communities and <unk>
Well, <unk>
<unk> Oh, my God, God bless you.
God loves me.
And I guess so.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video outside of his house in California, National <unk>
In 2010, I was seen 23 million times.
So this graph shows the <unk> the <unk> of the universe.
<unk> didn't tell you a video game.
So I just wanted to share a quick story.
That's what you do if you call <unk> <unk> <unk>
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in <unk>
So what happened next?
It was <unk>
<unk> <unk> published this guy who <unk> the video to the <unk>
The creators of trends like <unk> <unk> are showing us new and interesting things and the <unk> to a <unk> public public audience.
And <unk> <unk>            You all want to come up with the end of a week, the end of week.                    And so I don't think we can have this conversation without talking about this conversation without talking about this video, but
<unk> <unk>
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This chart shows the frequency of it.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video looked like this.
So what happened to this <unk>
Well, it was true.
And if you ask those other questions.
But what happened this day this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, I took <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael <unk> <unk> <unk> Science Foundation was one of the first people to do a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or a group of trends are going to be a view of sight and they share with a higher public public process.
And so this community of people who shares this great love and then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there's 10,000 <unk> <unk>
So just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the entertainment entertainment of the 20th century, this personal participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with it.
<unk> <unk> is an animation <unk> with a <unk> music with a <unk>
So that's everything.
This year you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's cool, you know that there's a version of three hours that has seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats watching the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet.
There was <unk>
Somebody made a version of it.
And then it became very powerful.
All of a sudden, all of a sudden, a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a silly joke to something that we can all form in.
Because it's not just <unk>
Who might have predicted something else?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> <unk>
What do you think it might be that you could have written that <unk>
In a world where you get two days of video video for a minute, just the only thing and unexpected and unexpected and unexpected and unexpected things you can do is <unk>
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who loves the <unk> in New York City in New York City.
<unk> I was <unk> by the <unk> but they often have obstacles that you can get paid off by the <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise and the surprise of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I managed to see that five million people see the idea.
So this approach is worth all of the new things that we do in a whole new way.
And all of this leads us to a great <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does it mean?
<unk> <unk>
KA: What does it mean?
So the creators of a creative communities of participation, which is completely immersed in a new kind of media, of a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the truth.
As I said before, one of the most important <unk> of the world, <unk> <unk> started in <unk>
Not <unk> permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little masters of our culture.
These are not the features of old media, just are the ones we have, but <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the things.
Imagine the first <unk> a man by burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a man whose entire life had been supported in the only unit of unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> the fact that his life had been completely <unk>
The words, for so many friends now are now <unk>
It's <unk>
<unk> <unk>
He's my grandfather.

But our lives are much more than our own.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story of <unk> but <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at the dawn <unk>
My mother, my mother, <unk> had just 18 years ago when her father died, and a marriage <unk> and two little girls.
For her, life had been meant to be a task for her family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't see.
And then from a <unk> of four years that the fiction, a boat <unk> a boat <unk> to sea <unk>
Every adults knew it.
The biggest fear was the rape and death.
As most of the adults, my mother had a <unk> with a <unk>
If we were <unk> first of all, my sister and I, and then she and my family.
My first memories are that boat, the constant rate of the engine, the <unk> the <unk> <unk> in every wave, and the rest and the rest of it.
I don't remember when I was a number of times, but they were working with the courage of men on our boat, or the engine -- and not being able to recover for six hours.
But I remember the lights on the platform on the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who passed and came up with the journey was too much to her, and the first apple I would argue is because of the men of the <unk>
There had no apple at the same time.
After three months in a refugee camp in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over four years by giving a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> whose population is <unk>
Unlike the suburbs of middle class whose existence was in <unk> there was no sense of it.
The smells that were coming from the <unk> were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English is <unk> between the people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in flow, then in a assembly line, working six days, twice a day.
Even so, I found time to study English and get a title in <unk> <unk>
We were poor people.
All of the dollars were <unk> and it was an extra substance in English in English and mathematics, and <unk> didn't mind what was going on, which was usually <unk>
Two hundred base pairs for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school letters to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there had been very rare and profound <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk>
At home, he was wrong.
Something in me is <unk>
It was a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I was <unk> in the same way.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were <unk> on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother in the home.
My mother suffered from <unk> all of the boat.
And my task was to be wakes up until his <unk> came to be able to get <unk>
She opened a computer store and then studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do the end of it, but <unk> and <unk> and <unk> were stuck between two <unk>
They were able to get water.
And they created <unk>
I lived in worlds today.
In one, it was the gay student of improvisation with what he did.
On the other hand, I was <unk> in the lives of <unk> Men," <unk> by violence, breast cancer and depression.
But many of them got help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of creativity, I met the young woman in the year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but its <unk>
So <unk> <unk> <unk> was now <unk> and so <unk> and social activist he invited me to talk to you in places that I never heard of, and in houses whose existence would never be.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about it.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to go to the <unk> and the <unk> of life in a <unk> <unk> -- a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and a half years -- the three still in the same way.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
I reminded me that I was now at the same age that she had when we got to the ship floor.
He had never been an option.
<unk> told me -- and you're not what you don't know.
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And the more often, we talked about it.
I met people from all the roads of life, so many of them doing what they were working on, living on the border of possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I could not be in a <unk> life.
I had to have another piece of paper.
And I realized at the same time that this time being a unknown, a museum in the scene -- and it's not just that it's good, but it's something that is something that will be a gift from the boat.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I read enough steps out of my mind, so to know that, yes, that the world will be <unk> but not in the way we do.
<unk> who didn't have been <unk>
There was a power there -- a optimism -- a lot of <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And so I went on.
And I went to a small group of people for the <unk> who said, "You can't <unk> it was a <unk>
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I did a giant soup of soup that all <unk>
<unk> until the night.
Most of our ideas were <unk> but some large, and we opened up to us.
I took the decision to move the U.S.
And then one of them was just a little bit.
My wish.
Three months later, I had <unk> and the <unk> was <unk>
Before that, let me tell you about my story.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who was the person who died.
There was no change for centuries.
His father died after she died.
The mother grew up alone.
By the 17 years it became <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without her husband, he caused a <unk> to the <unk> and taking the cause she would be, and much more <unk> caused when he died.
The can't come to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room in a hotel room, when she was sent to one degree <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called <unk>
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell them stories and we make sure that we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why do your hand is hot and the rest of the body <unk>
They have taken their hand from the <unk>
They don't have <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through the women.
Given who we were and how life came together, we can now see that men who have come to our lives would have been <unk>
And it would have been <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who might want to want to do that for you."
But I'm afraid the privilege of the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, and the brave <unk> in every wave, the <unk> rate of the engine, the vast pace that you don't understand.
I don't know.
But if I could give you a little bit and see what I do.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this today, in the fourth or last year.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
We were <unk> of how nothing has changed since the time of the ancient <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel to a car and get the sky.
Now we do that.
So at that time when I was <unk> the great Greek warrior -- I had no idea what I would do and with a <unk> and a <unk>
Now we do the same thing.
The conclusion that we got it was that the machinery had been replaced by the end."
And so I did.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I was <unk> this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a <unk> if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the <unk>
Out of my grandfather I gave me his <unk>
And this piece of technology that was 50 years was for my first time.
He turned it into a golden door to a world full of images, and <unk> in my imagination.
And I had the sense that mobile phone, the luxury of the luxury of the luxury of the luxury of the luxury and the cameras will keep <unk>
<unk> our personality.
And so I went back to this technological world to see how we use it to create <unk> rather than <unk>
<unk> <unk> from 16 years.
That's why when I saw it, I saw a <unk> device able to connect the readers out of the whole world.
You can know how you take the book, you can know how you take the book, you can know how you take the book, you can know how you take the book, you can know how you take the book, you can know how you take the book, you can know how you take the book, you can know how you take the book, you can know how you take
Where we are, where we are.
<unk> the text with the image of the image, the sound and the <unk>
The narrative becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does it mean?
I'm about to launch an interactive app for you.
He says, <unk> your fingers on each other.
And so ...  He says, "This is <unk> I write my name <unk>
And so I come back a character from the book.
In several moments it gets me a <unk> -- you know where you know where you live with GPS -- that comes to me.
My little little bit inside of all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about it.
And I don't mean <unk> and I don't mean that magic of childhood, to those ideas that are <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned out to me.
So over here, we have to change the way.
And really, it turns out your way to the way of the book.
Another idea that I worked with was a little girl was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I refer to to this particular device inside of it.
And this opens a map.
In all sorts of tasks, there are always maps but have been maps like this.
This is a map that comes in, and it's a map of the rest of the book.
In certain parts of the book are also <unk>
Now I'm going to show you.
Another interesting aspect for me is to create an Indian content and a <unk>
These are the <unk>
We all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their <unk> <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of <unk> for millennia, in an old <unk> and a book.
That's why we're bringing back into a human history.
In a story that is a story that is happening as the environmental crisis.
And by talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that kids have been raped by their <unk> they haven't come to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our kids into the natural world with its technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure in which you have to go out at the outside, to take the camera or it, and then collect images from different colors.
Anyway, I had a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For some reason, kids are already there.
So to recover this <unk> <unk> you have to go out and, in a way, <unk> a picture of a flower and then <unk>
On the other chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
In this way it creates a digital collection of photos that then you can put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have gone on.
Within the variants of the connection between the right, the Earth and the technology is a lot of possibilities.
In the next book, we have an interaction where you go out with the <unk> and the video on it, and you actually see a group of <unk> <unk> <unk> that appear on the inside of the house.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves with light.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and technology and so on.
<unk> the sun.
We are coming back to our children and we are going to the natural world and the natural world and the magic and love and love that sat through a simple story.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I would like to talk to you about why many of them are <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we let the patients.
And one of the things that we did at the University of <unk> was it was <unk> to a director of the family.
And not in a very scientific way, she has a little coffee cup or tea and I asked patients, family and <unk>
How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems that all, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> are <unk> they are already <unk>
This is my <unk> It's a very simple question.
It has a contradiction.
All the morning I did.
And yeah, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to 95 percent.
But it's so simple, that every time I hit my data on Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my body problem is, not at the same time that I need care or some of that -- or some of that -- but you can see it.
But there's another thing.
As a number of you know, I have more than four followers on Twitter on Twitter.
So every morning I connect my car to my car and before you go to my car, the people start to <unk> I think you need to be a doctor.
That's the best thing that might happen, because it's pressure of the base of the Sun to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients who let patients stop working.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some activity in order to have more control of their health.
From the next week you will be able to be available from the next week to be able to be available from the next week to be able to be available from the next week to be available from the next week to be available from the next week to be available from the next week to be available from the next week to be available from the next week
This little <unk> attached to an iPhone or another one.
And the people in their houses, taking their blood pressure, they take their blood pressure, they would be <unk> to their doctor, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where the patients assume a position, they become <unk> and to be 160 percent of their own <unk> but also can help us help care of the health of the health of the health and the challenges we face, the <unk>
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also by <unk>
And one of the things that we did I'd like to share with you with a video of you.
We all have <unk>
Maybe even we have in our bodies.
We know perfectly where the <unk> <unk> in <unk>
And also where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can figure out how fast food is.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this <unk>
We talked about it.
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saved lives at this moment.
What we did was we did it in the Netherlands, in the Netherlands, in the U.K.
We created a web website, and we asked the audience to see a <unk> for favor of <unk> where, and when it's open, it's because it's open, because sometimes open up to <unk>
And over 10,000 <unk> they were already reported in the Netherlands, in the U.K.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we did an app for it.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you are in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> you can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks to use your cell phone, to find the closest <unk> what you can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this is not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we call it <unk>
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, so that we will help us find and act and act as a center for the <unk> in the world.
Every time you're standing in bed, and somebody <unk> can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can do it.
I'd like to invite companies around the world that they could help <unk>
Could you be able to be able to use it or <unk> people of <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in their place.
Please join in this and not only improve health, but take control of it.
Many thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I'm here to share with you.
Or it's <unk>
Because, of course, they are photographs that can't take with their <unk>
My interest in the photograph was woke up with my first digital camera at the age of 15 years.
I used it with my favorite passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because by using the camera and the process was in the <unk>
And when you take a photograph with a camera and the process ends when the <unk>
For me, photography had more to do with being in the right place at the time.
It seemed that anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start to press the <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very <unk> road in a very different way.
But it has a <unk>
And despite it, it holds a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say that, I say no.
Because, of course, it's not something that can be <unk> but I always want it to look like it seems to have been captured in some way like this.
<unk> where you will have to think about a moment to find out how to figure out how to figure out how to figure out how to figure out how to figure out how to figure out how to figure out how to do it.
It has more to do with capture an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it look like?
These are the details or the <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What is it that creates <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is the perspective.
But at the end is our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface of it.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is it.
So I think the <unk> are very simple things.
I see it as a puzzle of reality in which we take different pieces of reality and we get them to create a reality of how we do it.
I'll show you an example here.
Here we have three very <unk> objects that we all can relate to the world today.
But in a certain way, you can create something that even looks like this.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So we <unk> the brain because the brain doesn't understand, the fact that it really doesn't have any sense.
And I see the same process as we combine them.
It really does really make different things.
And the things that make a picture of a picture looks like I think are those where we don't even know the things that are around us in our lives.
But when you combine photographs in a very important way, because in another way you see something like this.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that I will continue to do this.
As you can see, these images are not very new.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the photos are going to have the same kind of light.
And these two images with these <unk> were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of the different images with a <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
I could think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom part is <unk>
But this image is totally filled with photographs of different places.
In the personal staff I think it's easier to create a place that you find because you don't need to put the ideas in your head.
But it requires a lot of money.
And as I thought this idea in winter I knew that I had several months for <unk> to find the different parts of the world.
For example, the fish was captured on a chip.
<unk> are from a different direction.
So the <unk> was captured in a <unk>
And yeah, I even did the red house at the top of the island of the island so it looks more <unk>
So to make a significant result of that is that it makes it really interesting.
You always start with an idea.
And then you have to combine different things.
And here every piece is very good.
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful and at the same time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I'm going to show you a slide on technology, very exciting.
Please raise your hand.
This is a diagram that took out of an hour.
I'm not interested in so much to show you the details of the stuff.
It's about a analysis that we were doing on the power of the <unk> <unk> versus the power of local networks in local communities.
The interesting thing about this is that this is like a lot of other that we tend to see, it's kind of a kind of small line on <unk>
In other words, every step here represents a order of magnitude on the scale of the <unk>
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves -- it's something else.
So here is something happening.
And that's exactly what I'm talking about.
Why? Why?
<unk> more intensity because writing on paper.
Why do <unk> curves at home?
The answer is that if you put them on a normal curve where you can say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to share with you, the diagram would look like this.
It would be something like that.
It doesn't tell you.
But if you go back for example, some other technology, like transport, transport, a <unk> <unk> would be very dumb, would you see a <unk>
But if you happen something like this, it gives you a change.
If the technology of transport is as fast as the <unk> <unk> morning we could take a taxi and be in Argentina in 30 seconds.
But it's not going to happen.
There is no unprecedented unprecedented in the history of the technological development of the technological growth that every few years of the world.
The question I want to argue today is -- if these curves -- if these curves -- we see that we don't follow a lot of data.
It's not possible to hold this change as well.
<unk> one of two things.
Or will it become a typical curve -- I know that until it comes to something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, because I think maybe something will happen.
So we will now be in the middle of a second.
On this line, we are in a transition of what used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and I thought, what is that new way that we have the world?
And what new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very <unk>
I remember a kid in the past year -- and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's what we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel that we feel that something is happening.
And that happens a lot.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot to think about 30 or 50 years because it's all so different to extrapolate what we're doing today has no sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could be that transition that <unk>
But to do that, I will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and <unk>
Because I think the only way to understand it is to take away and look at the whole thing.
The scale of time in which I would like to do it is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image has sense if we look at each one billion years.
So you go back about two million years ago when the Earth was a great rock with a lot of chemicals that I was going to show up.
If we look at the way that we organize those chemicals we give us a sense of how things happen.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin of the universe, and I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and that is that, at that moment, there had been some <unk> of oil with all sorts of chemicals on their left.
Some of those oil drops through a particular combination of chemicals that they did to put materials out of the outside and so on.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms that were <unk>
But those drops were not dead, in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time you have a <unk> distribution of chemicals that are <unk>
So every <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, the drops that somehow will be better at being better at the time to incorporate the chemicals in the <unk> <unk> <unk> more chemicals and <unk>
And they lived over time.
It was a form of life, a very simple life form -- but things got interesting -- interesting things -- interesting when these females learned the trick of it.
Somehow we don't understand very well -- these <unk> learned to store information.
They were willing to get information, which was the recipe of the cell in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution doesn't sense, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were going to be able to do.
And the amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have been completely stable since evolved over two million years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, our genes have exactly the same code, that same system.
In fact, every living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same thing.
And one of the things that I did just by <unk> We can write things with this question.
Here I have 100 <unk> of dust that I try to hide the people from the <unk>
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this one, and I wrote my personal data on this clip of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal credit card -- I have a lot for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and is here.
If I was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and it would have spread across the room.
What was the next <unk>
Imagine the DNA was an interesting thing.
This made these cells were happy with other people.
But then there was another big step in which things were <unk> very different and it was that these cells started to use and communicate information and use information to communicate with them.
I don't know if you know it, but the bacteria can use it.
So for example, for example, evolved resistance to others.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of <unk> because the bacteria are <unk>
This communication gave place to the communities that, in a certain way, they were together in a sense, and a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all of the individuals in that community -- more and more people were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point was when these communities came so much that, in fact, they came together and they decided to write all the recipe from the community in a different direction.
The next stage of the interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have <unk> communities of many different types of cells working together as a single person.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell is not the heart cell, or the <unk> or the <unk> or the brain, and so the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting than cell levels, something we call a <unk>
The next level happened within these communities.
These started to <unk>
And to build very special structures that did not process information in community.
They're <unk>
So the neurons are the ones that use the information that the information that these mobile communities are.
In fact, they started to <unk> within the community being responsible for being able to understand and convey information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an idea.
Because at the time as <unk> <unk> <unk> was in the duration of a organism, and not in the period of time.
So a organism would be able to learn to not eat any fruit because they were going to be the last time that it was.
That could happen during the life of an organism because before they had built these data processing structures that had been learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals who ate that fruit of individuals who ate that fruit out.
And so the fact that the nervous system that the nervous system of these data structures is hugely critical process.
Because evolution might be going to happen to an idea.
It might happen at the time necessary to play.
But then, of course, individuals figured out the trick of nature.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention of an incredible experience.
I have a very complicated idea -- a very complicated idea.
I'm sitting here spending a few <unk> and hopefully by building a similar idea and <unk> in their heads that drives a certain analogy with me.
But we took something very complicated to it in sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work as a whole.
In fact, as humanity, we've started doing <unk>
We now spend a lot of periods of time in terms of the <unk> organisms -- our computer methods and information processing information.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer video tape <unk> and so are the mechanisms that we now build to manage that information.
And so that is in something much larger and faster and capable of evolved more than what we did before.
Now evolution can happen to us.
You know, the <unk> evolutionary <unk> in which it produced some evolution of the <unk> program to our eyes.
And now we've got a long time.
The first stages of history that I would tell you to tell you a billion years ago.
The next step, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The cell phone, and it took less than a million years.
And each cell as electronics, seems to take just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I suppose that <unk> is the right word to name something that does its own pace of change.
The more quickly it changes it.
And I think that's what we look at in this explosion of light.
We see that the process is <unk>
But I get my life to design computers and know that the mechanisms that job jobs for <unk> would not be possible without the technological advances in the world.
But now design forms that it would be impossible for me to make a difference.
I don't know that every single transistor in that machine works.
There are thousands of millions.
Instead of that, with the <unk> designers we think of as we think about it, we put it in the machine and the machine with that makes it something that was going to be far further and faster and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes they use methods that we don't even understand it.
So a particularly interesting method that I've been using here is the same thing.
So we put together in the machine an evolutionary process, which is actually on the scale of us.
And for example, in the most ambitious cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of this.
And we say, "Hey, please you can run a hundred million <unk>
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, run all those programs, and take those who are more <unk> to what we want to do.
In other words, I define what I did.
Let's say that I want to use a simple example.
So we found the programs that are going to come to help to help us.
And of course, it's unlikely that some of them are kind of out of instructions, <unk> numbers, numbers, numbers, numbers, numbers, numbers, numbers, numbers, Come on.
But then, luckily, by lucky, he could find two numbers on the right list.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those light sequences that better did the <unk>
And we started those and <unk>
And now <unk> the best <unk>
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who are <unk> and that the children are <unk> the properties of both <unk>
So we got a new generation of programs of programs that had a little bit more success.
And we say, "Please <unk>
<unk> again.
And so on.
And we try to figure out how to do it with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few decades.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in particular cases in a few hours.
At the end, we end up with programs that are going to take numbers so well.
In fact, they are much more efficient than I could have written your hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you.
I've been trying to see how it works.
They're <unk>
But then the <unk>
In fact, I know, I know, I have the safety that you do because you come from a set of hundreds of thousands of programs that I want.
In fact, their lives are <unk>
Once I was in a <unk> with <unk> <unk> and he takes a card and he says, "Look at this.
He says, "The airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight -- doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they are there.
So that's why we started to depend on computers to do good design processes to do good things.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than that it produces the normal space.
However, we don't understand all the choices that we have.
In that sense, it's in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make a lot more quickly and so we can be able to run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing is increasingly going faster and so I think it seems to be so difficult.
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we are at a moment because of the <unk> organisms -- when they got <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we do.
We are at the point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very helpful to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of what we do.
But now comes the lunch and I think to stop here before I was <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that is me.
And I've got a long time to give you a part of my fake <unk>
Before I try to treat my talk, let's talk a little bit about that.
Why not?
We are close to the end of the final line.
We love NASA, right?
baseball is full of <unk>
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's about <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and they use them to form a big team of violence.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you.
It's called <unk>
And we talked about carbon.
That means that the <unk>
That means by going to launch the ball into the game of play without being <unk> and anybody who wants to be <unk> at the first time, it doesn't come to time, and the second foundation will be <unk>
<unk> <unk>
You know how you call a <unk> of 300 in the <unk>
Well, really, you know, maybe of the <unk>
You know how you call a baseball <unk>
And by the way, that's somebody who is a <unk>
<unk> like the Grand Line, the last player in the United States has been <unk> in <unk> at over 400 dollars.
Now you can see this in my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they are with a surgeon who has also a set of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work.
Now suppose they live in a straight place, and a dear to be wanted to have two <unk> <unk> <unk> and your family doctor goes up to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is <unk>
But you know what?
She's getting better for this year now.
And his left have been <unk>
This is not true.
But I'm going to tell you that.
What you believe is that it must be the average score of a heart surgeon or a <unk> of a nurse or a <unk>
<unk> very well.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in the entire medicine knows the correct of a good surgeon, or <unk>
What we do is, though, is that the world, and I will tell you about the wisdom of being human.
That would be that I would be able to make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in school.
I was a <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian recently was studying up to a blood test for a baby.
Maybe so.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the Council of nurses <unk> General <unk> not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
In my class, <unk> the origin and the work of <unk> the seed of each ant comes out of the <unk> the <unk> diagnosis of <unk>
And I even knew the <unk> diagnosis about how to fix the <unk>
And as much as you get more and more knowledge.
And I was very impressed by <unk>
And <unk> from the medical school with the impression that if you <unk> everything, then you know everything, or most of all, you know everything, because I'm going to give you an example.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was resident in a college hospital, in Toronto, when they brought to the lunch lady in the service of the emergency room.
At the time I was given to the <unk>
And when I was just trying to go to a backpack I had to go to that patient and get to that one.
And he will report to the head of his needs.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a lot.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both sides, what I have done is a heart attack.
In these conditions, the heart leaves and, instead of putting your blood forward, your blood goes forward, your blood goes down to your lungs, and you become blood, and that's why there are <unk>
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I did.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on his heart.
I gave him <unk> pills and so he could eliminate it so that he could take it off.
And in an hour or two, she began to feel better.
And I felt good.
And that's when I did the first <unk> I sent it to her home.
And I actually made two more.
I sent him to his house without talking to the head of his own.
I didn't carry the phone and I did what I should have done, that I was calling my boss and <unk> with him so that the <unk>
And if my boss had seen, he would have been able to get rid of it.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
You might not want to be a resident to be an artist.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and capable of taking care of my patients without even taking care of my patients without even <unk>
The second mistake that I did was it was worse.
When they send their home, they didn't care about a voice in my inner voice that said, <unk> is not a good idea.
In fact, I was so confident that until I asked the nurse to go to the lunch lady who is okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said, "I love my total <unk> I think I'm going to be here."
I remember as if I was one.
So it was that they signed the high, and the ambulance next together with the ambulance workers took their home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad idea.
But I started with my work.
At the end of the day, <unk> to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where I was my car to go home. At that moment I made something I don't do normally know.
I went through the emergency room.
And there another nurse, not the <unk> of the lady <unk> before, but another one told me three words, those three words that most physicians of the emergency room.
Other people are afraid of fear as well, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and it's that we see the patients <unk>
The three words are <unk>
He said, "The patient was sent to his <unk>
I asked the other nurse to complete <unk>
And I thought, she <unk> with the same question.
She was fine.
But I returned to the edge of death.
At an hour of an hour of having come to her house, after I was walking around a collapse and his family called the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> was brought into a blood pressure with a blood pressure <unk>
And I was just going to do it.
So the emergency emergency room.
He gave him medication to climb up the blood pressure to climb up the blood pressure to climb up.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> up to the <unk>
I had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy, and I was hoping against all hope that they were <unk>
And in the next two or three days it was obvious that it never happened.
I had a brain loss.
The family came together in the family.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And at the ninth day, the lady left her lunch lady and her mother and father.
They say that they never forget the names they die.
That was my first experience.
The weeks ago, I was <unk> by this and I heard for the first time that there is in our medical culture, and I felt <unk> <unk> without feeling too healthy because you can't do it with your <unk>
So you do it and you never get the <unk>
It is that shame that you hold a lot.
The shame of what I'm talking about is what makes us feel very wrong about it.
It's the thing that tells us that what we did was we did not know that what we did was we were right.
And that's great.
And it wasn't for my <unk>
I spoke to the family and I am sure that they were <unk> things and made sure that I didn't know what to do.
And I followed those questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why did I sent him to her <unk> Why didn't I tell my <unk> Why didn't I do my <unk>
And in my worst <unk> why did I make a mistake so <unk>
Why did I know?
Shortly after that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And in a <unk> day, it opened the sky and finally went back the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better than that.
And I made myself a deal with myself in which if we <unk> the efforts to be perfect for not being perfect for the <unk>
And so forth.
I went back to work.
But it turned out to be true.
Two years later, I was an emergency room in the emergency room in the hospital in Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he was there.
And I looked at his point.
He was sent to her home.
But while he was leading to the door I kept on his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my <unk> <unk> my head asked me to talk to me about his office.
And I got the three words, right?
It takes the patient to see for a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk>
He had a <unk> potentially <unk> called <unk>
You can go back to Google -- it's an infection, not from the start, but it's going to be on the top, and it can cause the touch of those <unk>
He didn't know.
So you can make antibiotics for the <unk> and you give the few days.
And through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back and came back to work, until that happened over and over and over again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially to work in a hospital, because it was <unk> to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't get sent to home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought it was a <unk>
And I said, "I want to tell you a little bit about it, but it turned out a colleague who was looking at the patient -- a certain sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner.
The other patient was with a lot of it.
He made liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague who was <unk>
And I looked at it, and at the bottom of the bottom right, I called the <unk>
And both of them were <unk> and they were very simple.
But every single case I did.
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as many colleagues say, is a <unk>
The most profound that have been over the last five years.
<unk> <unk>
And here is the problem: if I can't tell you, and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> I tell you what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that we don't make the same <unk>
If I could go to a place like this, I wouldn't have to have an idea of what you thought of me.
When it was the last time you heard somebody to talk to anyone to talk to each other.
Of course in a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you don't hear someone talking about your own mental problems.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, and my colleagues also, that a <unk> in my hospital -- the wrong leg filled that I would have been working on the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
<unk> <unk>
It's the system that there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and the ones that are <unk> the ones that can't sleep and the ones that have <unk> outcomes and those who have <unk>
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, like antibodies that start to attack that person.
So we have the idea that if you go from medicine to the people who do all of us come up with us.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of <unk> and medical journalism -- I've done a personal study of a bad healthcare and medical errors in order to learn it, from the first article that I wrote for me to Toronto <unk> to my <unk>
And what I learned is that the mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where the mistakes are going to happen every day, where one of the 10 drugs that one of 10 drugs -- in the hospital are <unk> or <unk>
In this country, they die 24 hours per day.
The U.S. Medical Institute showed 100 <unk>
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as well.
And so on.
A <unk> system where the knowledge is driven every two or three years, and we are not <unk>
So I play the dream with all of that.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive stem cells that allow us to make a perfect place for a patient with pain in the body.
Now, let's take a look at the same patient with a pain in his chest, and he comes back with his eyes <unk> and with my shoulder, and all of a sudden, my story.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things as well.
And my patients are not paying their symptoms as well as the same way.
For all of this, the mistakes are real.
So if we take the system like us, and we take all of the professional professionals to <unk> you know, you don't have any money.
And with the people who don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> art, art, art is a lot of saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would say all of you all over the world."
And his students were <unk> to go back to the head and get rid of it, and then tell their stories.
They want to tell their stories.
<unk> I could be able to say, "Look, we don't do the same thing.
They need a context where you can do it.
They need a medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The doctor is a human, you know human, and it's a human, and it's not part of your mistakes, but you have to learn about what happened to teach others.
<unk> their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their problems.
<unk> the errors of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a way to love and support for all of us.
And it works in a medical culture, which recognizes that human beings are carrying the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes instead of it.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk>
I'm a human <unk>
And I feel a lot of it, but I really feel something that I can convey to others.
I don't know what you think of me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk>
You know how many decisions we take for a day.
You know how much we choose to do it.
I recently did a survey to more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that says you pick a half a half a day.
It's not a lot about a research followed over a week to a group of presidents of companies.
The researchers held the different tasks of <unk> by these executives and the time that they were going to take care of their values.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> every day.
And half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Just an example.
Now think about their dreams.
You know how many of you belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of you in a <unk>
How do we apply the way that we make those <unk>
Today I want to talk today about one of the biggest problems of the <unk> choose to do the job.
I want to talk to you about the problem and about a few of them.
And as I talk about this, I'm going to give you a few questions and I need to know your answer.
When I do a question, as I am -- your hand is just if you want to burn it.
In another way, when you do a question, if your answer is to be positive for please give a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, they're ready to hear about the problem of the <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, I <unk> this very, very quickly, at least in that time it was very exciting.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going into a <unk> park in <unk>
There were as 250 different kinds of parts, and <unk> over 500 different types of fruit and vegetables and a few of the <unk> <unk> and this was when they were <unk>
I loved to go to that store, but I was on one occasion, but on one occasion, I was never alone.
This is the <unk>
They had over 75 classes -- including those who were in a box called <unk> <unk>
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked him well this strategy to offer all these <unk>
And he pointed out the <unk> <unk> that came out every day, usually with his <unk>
So we decided to do a little experiment with <unk>
And yet, let's see.
They had <unk> like this.
And he said, <unk> just at the entrance to the <unk>
We put out six <unk> of six <unk> or 24 different languages, and we look at two things: First of all, what if people were willing to stop <unk>
More people stopped when there was <unk> when there was only 30 percent that when they were just six, a 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
Of those who stopped when there was <unk> just the three were going to buy <unk>
And from those who stood when they were six, we saw that 30 percent.
If we do the <unk> the people were six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found out that if they were <unk>
Well, to decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably don't know what to do to preserve the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of it is the problem of options that affect us in good decisions.
And we decided not to be <unk> even when this doesn't work.
Now the theme of the <unk>
I'm going to tell you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in which we look at the decisions about savings for about a million Americans, from about a million years ago.
And we were interested in looking at if the number of funds available available available plans to reduce the program <unk> <unk> people to save the future.
And we found that there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that were coming from two, to 6,000 different options that were coming from two different ways.
And we found that the greater the number of funding was <unk>
So if you look at the equator, we see that in the plans that offer two <unk> the rate of participation was about 70 or more, not as high as possible.
And in the plans for about 60 or 60 years, the rate of participation is <unk> <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there are more options, even in that case, there is consequences of it.
So for those who they decided to participate, as much as a number of options, more people would be <unk> to avoid the actions or free funds to help to prevent the actions or the funds of investment.
At the same time, the more options, they were more willing to invest in a financial product.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we <unk> to optimize the financial welfare future.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences by providing more and more possibilities.
The most likely you likely to be able to do the decision, which is even when this is going on at the same time.
It is more likely to take the worst choices in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things out less <unk> even though objectively they will be better.
The main reason is that you can see that wide variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for ourselves, and to choose that staggering <unk>
I want to take you today four simple techniques that we've got in a way or another, in different research, in different ways, so that you can do it in your business.
The first is, <unk>
I've never heard before, but it has never been a bit more than today, which is less than today, which is less than today.
People always tell me when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But what we're looking at is what we are looking at if you decide that if you decide to get rid of <unk> options -- there will be an increase in <unk> -- there will be a better experience in the future.
When <unk> <unk> went from 26 different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> at 15, they saw a 10 percent increase in Medicine.
When the corporation <unk> the products to save the products that they are less <unk> they get <unk> in <unk> for two <unk> higher sales and lower cost.
You know that today's infancy, in average offer 45 products.
In a grocery store, you give about 100,000 products.
But the largest store in the world is <unk> and it is only <unk> <unk> a kind of tomato sauce <unk>
In the world of financial savings -- I think one of the best examples that have been done about how to handle better choices is the question of David <unk>
All the employees at Harvard are <unk>
They really want to give them 20 <unk> they give 20 or more.
You know, people often say, "I don't know as <unk>
All of these are <unk>
So the first thing I do is to ask the <unk> what is the differences between those things?
And if your employees can't <unk> you can't do it.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I talked to <unk>
He told me that she would be willing to offer people from this audience to this audience with all paid their money to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want it to you.
I'm going to leave you with a few seconds for <unk> and then I want to give you a position, if you're ready to take the <unk>
<unk> <unk>
They're not alone.
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew that there was a lot.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
Very good.
In fact, you had more information in the first turn, which in the end, but I can tell you that the second time was more real than the second time it was more real.
Because the images were made out of <unk>
And this leads me to the second technique to manage the problem of <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each choice, and that the consequences must be very <unk>
Why do people spend 15 percent more in average when they use credit card cards or credit cards or credit card <unk>
Because it doesn't look like this.
It turns out that it turns out to be more real, can be a very positive tool for people to do more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> who worked on <unk> these people in a meeting who were in a meeting who were <unk> to a <unk>
At that meeting that we <unk> exactly like <unk> we made a little <unk>
So what we added was that we put it on the staff who would think about the positive things that they would be in their lives if they were getting more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put into their <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can make more categories that happen.
So for example, this is a study that we did in a company.
What we saw was that we knew that in the United States at the end of the moment, the exhibition of magazines can contain all of these different types of <unk>
But you know?
Because the rating tells me how to <unk>
These are two examples.
One is called <unk> and the other <unk>
If you think about the left is <unk> and the right is <unk>
<unk> <unk>
If you think about the left is <unk> and the right is <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
On the left is <unk> and the right is <unk> but you know it's <unk>
So this strategy is completely different.
The categories have to tell us something about who we are.
So you can often see this problem with these huge rules.
And she told who they are.
My fourth <unk>
It turns out that we can take a lot more information than what we think, if we just <unk> a little bit.
We need to increase the complexity there.
I'm going to show you an example of what I want to say.
Let's do a good decision for a <unk>
This is a German manufacturer of cars that allows us to <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, so to put it on it.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that provide each one.
<unk> outside of the car, I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> <unk>
What I'm going to do is now be the order of the order that you need to do is the order that you need to do is be the order of the order that you are going to do.
So half of the customers are going to go from a lot of choices, 56 colors, a couple of things.
The other half of customers are going to go from few choices, four to 56 colors, a lot of money.
And what am I going to do?
What do you do?
If you were <unk> the button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk>
We found that the ones that are coming from a lot of options to do <unk> the button and over and over and over again.
<unk> <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, many times.
The same information, the same thing.
So the only thing I did was we managed to disrupt the order of the information.
If we started with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Though you pick the box of changes -- I don't tell you anything about the <unk> of <unk> -- from all of us -- of all of us.
We're excited to be very excited about a product that we now have more <unk> with the process.
For example.
I've been talking about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> you need to be able to get rid of <unk> <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> <unk> we can manage more categories with less <unk>
All of these techniques that I've showed you were designed to help the <unk> or better, to you to use them in their business, or for people who are going to be there.
It is that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful to <unk>
And the more careful we are in our own choices, we will be able to do the art of life.
Many thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
In the years we were in Germany <unk> if you had a writing machine to write it to the government.
And I had to register a piece of text from this machine.
And this is so that the government could track the <unk>
If you have an written written with the wrong message, you could track the footprint until the idea.
In the West we don't imagine that somebody could do this, what this was going to do is the freedom of speech.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer for any big manufacturer and a page, that page will end up having a little bit of <unk> <unk> in every page that you have to come from one of the things that makes you <unk>
That's happening today.
And nobody looks at this.
This is an example of how our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If we look at what happens in the world on the line, we can collect the attacks according to their <unk>
There are three groups.
They're <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The mobile phone is very easy to understand.
these kinds of money.
They use them to earn a lot of money to earn a lot of money.
There are really many cases in front of online, <unk> that <unk> money with their <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is Dr. <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk>
These are <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on.
These guys are doing their <unk> online, but they do it by illegal means, by <unk> to steal money from our accounts when we buy them in <unk> or they pick up our key data to get information from our cards when we buy a <unk>
The secret for America, two months ago, two months ago, <unk> the <unk> of this <unk> Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was <unk>
Mr. <unk> <unk> you don't know its <unk>
And I say that this is more likely than any of us to be a victim of a <unk> that of a real crime in real crime than a <unk>
And it's very obvious that this is going to happen.
In the future, most of the war.
The second group of <unk> in the importance of this is not driven by the money.
There is another thing that drives them into the centers, and they give them their homes.
Groups like Rome have been <unk> over the last 12 months in the last 12 months on the line.
Those are the three <unk> <unk> the criminals who do it for money, the <unk> as we think that they do it to protest and the last group are the national and the U.S.
And then we see cases like <unk>
That is a good example of government attack against their own citizens.
And <unk> is an authority of, from the Netherlands, or in reality, what it is.
<unk> the last fall of the last fall of <unk>
<unk> the safety of the site and <unk>
Last week I asked him at a meeting with representatives of the British government -- I asked one of the leaders if they <unk> the death of people to cause the attack of the attack in <unk>
And the answer was yes.
So how do people die of people like a <unk>
<unk> is an idea.
<unk> <unk>
So what do you do?
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, services, services like <unk> <unk>
Except, of course, an authority <unk>
And that was a <unk>
And in the case of <unk>
And what happened in the Arab Spring, and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the protesters in Egypt -- the headquarters for the secret name of the secret police -- in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of it.
Among those papers was this achievement.
And within that refugee, there were notes in a company called <unk> in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept a great scale of the citizens of the country.
He had sold this tool for 75,000 dollars.
The headquarters for the company is right here.
I mean, Western governments give us tools to governments to help us do this to their citizens.
But the Western governments also do this for themselves.
For example, in Germany, a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you are <unk> in a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it's going to be there.
It's <unk> the Internet on the Internet.
<unk> even tools like the <unk> <unk> to treat our computer with a <unk> to allow us to see all communication, and listen online, to get our data.
When we think about things like these obvious response to the obvious answer should be like, "Well, it seems like a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm a <unk>
Why do <unk>
I have nothing to do.
And that argument doesn't have any sense.
It's on the ground.
The privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy versus security.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right to be able to live forever.
<unk> <unk> anywhere in any future that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that you need to be worried about in the next 50 years.
Here is where I live, in Kenya, in the southern part of Silicon Valley.
These are the cows of my dad, at the bottom, and behind the prediction, and in the end, the National Security Council is <unk>
The National Park in Nairobi doesn't have <unk> in the largest part of the South, which means that they were wild animals like the ones that were <unk>
And they were going to go like <unk> and this is what they do.
<unk> our <unk>
This is one of the things they killed at night, and as soon as we sit down in the morning and we found it very wrong -- I felt very wrong -- because it was the only ones that I had.
My community, the <unk> we believe that we came out of the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so the ones we have.
So I grew up in <unk>
They are dying that they protect our community and the age, and they also are really fascinated with the problem.
So they die.
This is one of the six lions that killed them.
I think this is why there are so few of the <unk>
A child in my community, in the age of nine to nine years old, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing I was going to say.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought of lions and lions and whatever.
But I realized that I didn't really know what this didn't work, because even though I was killed by lions to see the <unk>
I don't know.
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I was trying to trick the lions to the lions so that I was close to the <unk>
But the lions are very intelligent --  they were the first day and they saw the <unk> and the second day, but the second day, but the second day, and they came up and they said, "This thing is always here.
So one night I was walking around the subway with a <unk> and that day male lions didn't exist.
And I found that lions are afraid of the light that they have.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on the way to turn the light.
And this is a little <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell cell on the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity to the little <unk>
And the blue box makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> give up to the outside, because there is where they come from the <unk>
And so this is how you see lions when you come to night.
The <unk> lights and the lions and the lions so they think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm going to give you in my mind.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago and since then, we never went back to having trouble with the <unk>
And the houses in the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is this one.
She had killed a lot of animals, and he asked me if I could put the light.
I told you.
You can see the <unk> you can see the lights are the lights for the <unk>
Since then, we've installed in seven houses in my community and are serving a lot of time.
And my idea is it also used to now use all of Kenya, to link to other predators as a <unk> and also is using to see elephants in the <unk>
Thanks to this <unk> I had the fortune to get a grant from one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International and I'm very proud of that.
My new school now is helping to raise funds and <unk>
It even led my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that don't have the have, and I teach them how to do it.
So a year ago, it was just a little boy in the office, and the cows were the cows of my dad, and I used to see that one day would be within one.
And here I am.
I had a chance to come to the first time at the first time.
And my great dream is to get to be an engineer and a pilot when he <unk>
I used to hate the <unk> but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the <unk> we can be with lions without any <unk>
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, so many thank you.
Chris Anderson: You don't see the exciting thing that is listening to a story like that.
So you get an example.
CA: You're working on other problems.
What's the next <unk>
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a short video -- CA: One about <unk>
<unk> I know that you were already invented to <unk> but I want to do it.
CA: Just once you take it once, and <unk> <unk> I have tried it before, but I got a <unk>  CA: And at the end of the day, Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We're going to <unk> in every step of my life.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best of the planet Earth.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk>
And I was really interested in it.
In school, we took all the time by studying the history of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan is <unk>
Though I sometimes wondered about the rest of the world, I thought I'd happen to be my whole life in North Korea, until everything changed from me.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first <unk>
But I thought my life in North Korea was right.
My family was not poor and I had never seen before.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When I <unk> this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't seen it in the two weeks alone.
We are <unk> together in the ground, and our bodies are so weak, that we are prepared to get rid of it.
I was very lucky.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the time when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life on the street, holding a kid in his arms looking at the face of his mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
It was a huge outbreak taken from North Korea to the <unk>
At the end of a million years from a million years ago, died during the century, and only a few was eating insects and <unk>
They also did more and more money for energy, all of my work, all around me was completely dark in the night except for the sea lights in China, except on the river from my home.
I always wondered why they had light and we were not.
This is a picture of North Korea in the night compared to the South Pole.
This is the <unk> <unk> which is the limit between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing them to <unk> <unk> <unk>
But many die. They die.
Sometimes I saw floating bodies on the river, too.
I can't tell you the details of how I came from North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of war, I was sent to China to live with the <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separate from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined that I was 14 years old.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family without my family.
And I had no idea how life would be the way.
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the refugees in China were born.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate of North Korean people.
And one day, my worst privilege was actually made of reality when I was diagnosed by the Chinese police police station, and I was <unk> at the police station,
Somebody had been accused by being <unk> then my skills in the Chinese language, and I had a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to happen.
If it didn't look like natural and <unk>
I thought my life was going to come back.
But I managed to control my emotions and love the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an official said to each other, "This was a <unk> report that is not <unk>
And let me go back.
Some of them in China are looking at me in <unk>
But many can be arrested for the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of questions.
Although the <unk> was eventually considered to be considered after a total <unk>
These days, they didn't have so much questions.
Every year, it was captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they are <unk> <unk> or executed in public public.
Although I was fortunate to meet a lot of other people.
It's tragic that the streets have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language, a new language and to find work, all the world can be <unk>
That's why after 10 years of hide my identity, I decided that I was going to go to South Korea from South Korea from South Korea from South Korea to South Korea to South Korea in South Africa.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much larger challenge of what they did.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
I also understood that there was a big gap between North and <unk>
We are all <unk> but by inside, we have come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
even through a movement.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
And where are you from?"
Suddenly, there was no country that I could call my son.
Although I was <unk> in South Korea in South Korea it wasn't easy -- I started to study to study for the <unk>
Just when I started to <unk> my new life, I got a call to my new life.
The authorities from North Korea, and some of the money I sent to my family, and, as I heard, my family was going to be focused on the force to a location in the <unk>
They had to do that they had to do their best.
And so I started planning how to help you.
The streets have to travel long distances on the way to the ground.
It's almost impossible to cross the border of North Korea, and South Korea and South Korea is almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea, and South Africa.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and came back to the border with North Korea and came back.
Because my family could not talk to Chinese -- I had to do it in a way, for over three miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
And the journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught a few times.
Once, our bus was stopped and <unk> by an official police officer and <unk>
And I was like, <unk> and started asking them questions.
As my family could not understand Chinese -- I thought my family would be <unk>
When the Chinese official came up to my family, I <unk> my family, and I said they were people who were <unk> who was <unk>
I looked at me and I looked at me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribing the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after going back the border, my family was killed and killed by the White House.
And after paying for <unk> and my family was diagnosed in a month, my family was liberated in a month, and I had my family.
But at the time, my family was killed, and over again in the capital capital of <unk>
This was one of the most low points in my life.
I made everything to release my family, and we were so close to my family, but my family was <unk> in prison in prison in the South Pole.
I was and I was on the front of the <unk> office and the police, desperately trying to release my family, and the police station, and the police station, and the <unk>
But I didn't have enough money to pay more money.
And I went back to school.
At that time, or the voice of a man who was wondering, "What is the <unk>
I was so struck by a stranger that a stranger would have been there.
With my poor English and with a dictionary I told you about the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for other people.
I was <unk> with all my heart, and I asked me what was going on.
I'm not sure.
"I'm helping the <unk>
I realized that this was a remarkable moment in my life.
And the funny thing happened -- a new hope for me and for the <unk> people -- when you more <unk>
And I showed that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are actually the rays of hope that the people were <unk>
By the time, after our long journey, my family and I sat down in South Korea and I sat down in South Korea and I sat down in South Korea and I sat down.
But getting their freedom is just half of the <unk>
Many of them are separated from their families and when they give a new country, they start with little or nothing of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice in the English language, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea, and the rest of the world.
Because so many of us continue in contact with family still still inside, and we send information and money that is helping us to change North Korea from the North Pole.
I have been very <unk> I've received a lot of aid and inspiration in my life, so I want to help New York, an opportunity to thrive with the international support of modern women.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more <unk> <unk> around the world, including on the stage of TED.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I live in India.
This is <unk> <unk> stores of <unk> food <unk>
So the planners of the city came together and we thought, we're going to change the name of the South Park to make something more, so it changed the way that it changed the world as if this is actually going wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles -- <unk> <unk> <unk> food -- <unk> <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, I live in a food desert desert in the food desert -- and the South Center -- <unk> home from the food parts of the <unk>
And the curious thing is that the food places to get more people out of food in the car.
People are dying of diseases like <unk>
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times larger than that, say, Beverly <unk> who's like 15 miles away.
I'm going to tell you that this works.
And I wondered, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go home you see the <unk> effects that your current food system has in your <unk>
And I see chairs in the <unk> and they are <unk>
I see <unk> centers of <unk>
And I think this must be <unk>
And the problem is that the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and the solution.
I already got tired of driving 45 minutes to go back and back to buy an apple that I don't have to see.
What I did, was to plant a food forest in front of my house.
On a ground of land that we call a <unk>
It's about 45 minutes.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to do it.
I said, "Well, I can do what I'm going to come in in honestly, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So it was like I decided to do it.
And so my group and I, L.A. came together and we started to plant our food forest -- <unk> trees -- you know, the nine things.
What we do -- we are kind of a group of paid care for the erosion of all the <unk> of all of the city and completely <unk> and everything we do is free.
And the <unk> was it.
And then somebody else.
The city goes on and in <unk> they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my <unk> the <unk> was made of.
And I said, "Come on right?
And a court order to plant food in a piece of land that no one <unk>  So I was like, "Well, <unk>
Because this time I wasn't going to work.
I L.A. had a story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk>
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States.
It's got <unk>
That's equivalent to 20 <unk>
That is space to plant <unk> million of them.
Why do we do that?
It was a plant to give about 10 minutes.
When a dollar a day, I will give you 75 dollars a day.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, you know your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for Center for <unk>
I grew up there, <unk> my kids there.
I was <unk> to be part of this reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to make my own life.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk>
And as an artist of <unk> who's <unk> walls, I am <unk>
I use the land, like a piece of wood, and the plants and the trees, and the trees, are my <unk>
It's <unk> of seeing what the earth can do, if you let her go.
You can't just imagine the amazing thing that is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witness how my garden became an education tool in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the environment.
We are the land.
You can see how it affects the guys.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
And then you get <unk>
I remember one time, that came a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and they were in my garage, and they were looking at me.
I, well, man, I felt wrong that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is in the street for one reason.
I felt when I was so close to people who were so close to me with hunger, and this was just <unk> why do I do this, people ask me not because people are going to steal your <unk>
So I say, "Why don't I have no fear that you go to <unk>
So that's in the street.
And so on.
I want the <unk> but at the time, I want to give you a <unk>
There was another occasion, where I put a garden in a shelter for <unk> at the center of Mars.
They were these guys, who helped me to download the <unk>
It was great, and they would give me their stories about how this was affected and how they used to plant their mom and his grandmother, and his grandmother, and he was really surprised to see how it changed, so just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 percent.
We've got to know about 50 people that are working and <unk> and <unk> all of them together.
If kids are <unk> <unk> boys are <unk>
If you are <unk> <unk> <unk>  But if nothing of this will happen, if you don't care about how the food affects your mind and your body, eat whatever you put into your head.
I see young people who want to work -- but they have this thing that you have -- I see people who are in this path designed for them, which doesn't lead to them, that doesn't lead to any side.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these guys to train these kids who are <unk> from their communities to have a good life.
And when we do this, who does it?
Maybe you get the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the scale of the land, it will never happen.
Now this is one of my favorites. This is something I want to do.
I want to plant all of you all the way where people can share food at the same time.
I want to take you back and go back and go back to me.
I don't know.
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not easy.
The curious thing about sustainability is that you have to <unk>
So what I'm talking about is to put people to work with people on the street, who know the joy, the pride and honor to grow their own food, opening their own food, opening up.
What I want to do here, we have to do this here.
I want everybody to become a <unk> <unk>
We need to change the way we do it.
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
That <unk> you take their <unk>
That is their weapon of innovation.
In <unk> if you want to meet me, you know, if you want to hear me, I don't know if you want to sit in touch and have meetings to talk to you about making some <unk> to talk to you.
If you want to go to the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
<unk> --  -- <unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road to me.
It's made of <unk> and asphalt is a good material for me, but it's not always, especially in days as today, where it works.
You can have a lot of water on the asphalt of the asphalt to the asphalt to the asphalt to the asphalt to the asphalt to the asphalt to the asphalt to the asphalt to the asphalt to the asphalt to the asphalt to the asphalt to the asphalt to the asphalt to the asphalt to the asphalt to the asphalt to the asphalt to the asphalt to the asphalt
And especially if you go into your bicycle and these cars, you get it, that's not really good.
In addition, the asphalt can make a lot of difference.
It's a <unk> material and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, -- very close to the cities, we wanted a <unk>
So the solution for that is to make roads to it.
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands, has pores and water can move through it, so all the water on the sides of the rain and then will have a road because it's easy to post and not <unk>
The noise also flows into these <unk>
Because it is very enough, all of the noise -- so it's a very simple road -- so it's a very simple one.
It also has <unk> of course, and the <unk> of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk>
First of all, there's a lot more and more and more and more and more and more, and so <unk> -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can harm its <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more <unk>
Sometimes you can create it.
<unk>
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can really see how the damage comes into this material.
It is a <unk> asphalt as I said, so it only has a little bit of <unk> between the <unk>
Because of the <unk> the light <unk> the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and if you were <unk> it would be <unk> and <unk> from the <unk>
So if you drive through the road, you get the <unk>
To solve this problem, we think of materials as <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is to use lots of steel, of steel, and we can cut the wool of steel in very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of steel on it.
And then you need a machine, like you see here, that you use for <unk> a <unk> machine <unk>
The <unk> can transform the steel, it's very good at that.
So what you have to do is heat the steel, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> flow of these <unk> and the stones are <unk> back to the surface.
So I used to now use an oven, because I can't bring the big machine to <unk> here at the time.
And the oven, is a similar system.
I put the exhibition, I now go to get to see what was going to happen.
This is the show that comes out now.
I told you that we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab for the <unk>
We got a lot of samples out there and then the government, and then the government, they really saw our results, and they said, "Well, that's really interesting.
So we got a piece of road, 400 feet from the <unk> <unk> where we had to do a piece of trial to test this material.
So that was what we did there, you see where we were doing the test on it, and then of course, this road last year without any damage to a lot of damage -- that is what we know about it.
We take a lot of samples from this road and we test them in the lab.
We did aging -- we put a lot of them in them, put a lot of them in them, and then they had to do with our <unk> machine -- and we went back to school.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we have done a material using steel fibers using the power of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, even if you can double the life of the road, you can even double the life of the surface.
And now, of course, they are curious about if this was also true.
We still have the show here.
Actually, you have to cool up first before you can show you how it acts as well.
But I'm going to ask you a question.
So let's zoom in.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember writing one morning with the sound of the <unk>
And my father was listening to me in his little <unk>
I had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news generally <unk>
<unk> 1990s.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
<unk> you can go to a <unk> school of <unk>
One morning I never did.
a truth.
You see, I was six years ago when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and made illegal <unk> that girls were at school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to join my older sister who could no longer be able to be able to go out to a school.
It was the only way that the two could <unk>
Every day, you have a different path for no one to go to where you are.
We had to hide the books in the market for the market for it that it looks like we were able to innovate.
The school was in a house, over 100 of us.
It was nice in the winter, but it's extremely <unk>
We all knew that we knew that we were the teacher, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Instead of when, in a while, my school was a week, because the Taliban were <unk>
We always wondered what they knew they knew about.
They were <unk>
Did you know where the <unk>
We were <unk> but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very fortunate to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was a extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote <unk> in New York City, in my daughter, my mother, my mother was to school and so his father was going to get it.
But my mother came back.
This is it.
It was done two years ago, just to turn our house into school for girls and women in our own neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that their children had to get education, even their daughters, even though they were in spite of <unk>
For him, there was a greater risk for not to educate her children.
For the years of <unk> I remember that there were moments in which I was very frustrated by our life and I was always interested in it.
I wanted to look at it, but my father said, <unk> -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can <unk> your house for a war.
But there is one thing that will always be you, which is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, you can get your education, you get it.
So you still want to do it.
I have 22 years.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the <unk> and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself a proud proud to graduate in <unk>
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> in his home for the courage to educate his daughters, it was one of the first <unk>
He's not just <unk> from my university degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, who I carry on the streets of Chicago.
My family believes in me.
I dream of a big dream -- but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
So that's why I'm the world's global <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
That's why <unk> <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, as they were, they were <unk> for them, despite them, despite an opposition <unk>
Like <unk> It's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
About a month, he and his daughter went out of the way from <unk> to his village, and, literally, <unk> from being killed by a bomb on the way, for me.
When you get to your house, you are the phone, a voice and your voice gives you that if I was still sending their daughter to school, they would go back to school.
<unk> now, if you <unk> -- and I don't harm the future of my daughter in his old <unk>
So what I've realized in Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind the majority of those people -- there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key in our success.
In fact, they are often the first <unk> that of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who were at school are told in <unk> remember, it was true.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is so different from the U.S.
And I find that Americans see Americans think that we can do it.
And so these changes are not <unk> so far after the U.S.
But when I went back to Afghanistan, when I see students in my school and their parents who were <unk> for them, I see the <unk> I see a <unk> and a <unk>
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and <unk> and every day the girls of <unk>
As me as I did.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I have never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never know a lot.
They've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution was inspired by the increasing of massive <unk> and so much of the <unk> revolution, like the <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a <unk> day and start a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a great thing.
Women and young men <unk> they were in the <unk> <unk> each of the <unk> and the <unk> of freedom, dignity and justice, social justice, social justice, social justice, social justice and social justice, social justice, social justice, social justice, social justice, social justice, social justice and social justice, social justice, etc.
They've shown a lot of courage in the face of <unk>
They have shown a great sense of renting from the <unk> from the United States.
Finally, after a period of six months of a brutal period of war and about about 50 billion -- we managed to release our country and <unk>
However, <unk> left a gigantic legacy of <unk> corruption and seeds of <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> of the devastation and the challenges, I have loved it, along with a lot of other women, reconstruct the civil society of <unk> <unk> a systematic transition and just a bit to democracy and the war.
It was about about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the <unk> <unk> 300 in <unk>
After a long period of time, I went back to <unk> and with a unique enthusiasm I started to organize workshops about the development of this idea, and of leadership.
With an incredible group of women we started the <unk> of Women <unk> by the <unk> a movement of women, leaders, who are very <unk> to advocate for the <unk> of the woman and the <unk> of the woman and the peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of time -- an environment that was increasingly <unk> which is more <unk> than the political <unk>
By the time our initiative was born.
The women won a <unk> Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, a little bit of a little bit of choices and the revolution as a whole, they were <unk> all the days of violence.
One day we came up with the news of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Another day -- with the news of the murder of the U.S. and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we came up with the news of the murder of civil war.
And every day, every day we come up with the government of the <unk> and their own rapes for human rights and their lack of respect for the world.
Our society made by a demographic mindset, is <unk> more, and has been away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
And he puts his <unk> and he became the genius of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here at all in all of these <unk> with our story of the success of the <unk> <unk>
More well I'm here today to tell you, that we, as a nation, we take the wrong decision.
We don't know.
Because the choices that we didn't have was not the peace, the stability and the safety of life.
The list of <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the candidates and the <unk> brought the peace and vice versa.
No, they didn't did.
What happened next?
Why is our society still <unk> and <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> so much for men as well as <unk>
Perhaps what happened was they weren't just women, but the values of compassion, they were going to be <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creation creation of what he needed the elections, which only <unk> the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the collective representation of the more we need to have the <unk> which is <unk> and <unk> of it.
We need to be able to act as agents of instability.
We need to start to act as agents of compassion and technology.
We have to develop a female speech, that not just <unk> but also put it in practice in place in which it is based on the way that it works, which is based on the <unk>
These are the ideals that an architect, <unk> for the war, needs in order to reach to the end of the city.
Because peace has a <unk> which is the <unk> and the <unk> between the male and the <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish a kind of existential <unk> before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all the traditions of <unk> has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the female <unk> and <unk> that will lead to the humanity of men and women, of which all tribes have <unk>
And so, just like the <unk> covers the <unk> that grows inside the <unk> array of compassion -- all of the <unk>
And so he says, "My God.
And so he says, "My <unk>
That all of them are <unk> the grace of the planet.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I'm here today to tell you about a particular question that has a very good answer.
It's about the secrets of violence -- and the question I'm going to address is that all of you do <unk> Why do she <unk>
Why would someone stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a <unk> or social <unk>
I'm just a woman with a story that I know.
I was 22 years old, I was <unk> at the University of Minnesota.
I had moved to New York to my first work as a writer and wrote in <unk>
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> American American American <unk> and I had a very large secret part.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, who I believed my soul <unk> me to the head of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The man, when I loved one of the more people in this world, put a <unk> in my head and <unk> <unk> more than I can imagine.
I'm here to tell you about the story of <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> of love, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
Until it could be your story.
I don't know a typical story.
I'm <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies working on the list of <unk> <unk> between these <unk> <unk> <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I learned about 20 years ago with my second husband and three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and a <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that the domestic violence, you can go to anyone, all of the sudden all of the sudden all of your health and education.
That's all right.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that the domestic violence is happening to women, which is a problem of women.
It's not true.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> relations and long duration or a long duration of the families, the last place in the families, the last place where we could deal or expect to find <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would go with a man who <unk> and actually I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women in between 16 and 24 years old have three times more possibilities than being victims of domestic violence than the other ages and over 500 women and girls from that age are killed every year by partners, and vice versa.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about violence -- their <unk> <unk>
I met <unk> in a cold water.
I was sitting on my side in the subway in New York and started <unk>
It told me two things.
The first one was that he was also <unk> from a university of <unk> <unk> and I worked in a very important bank for Wall Street.
But what was most impressed me in that first encounter was that it was ready and funny, and it seemed like a guy in the room.
And I had a little bit of <unk> a lot of <unk> and a <unk> hair -- and I looked at it.
One of the most intelligent things that made me <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the past.
It did it all over the early '90s.
We started coming out and loved everything in <unk> which was ready that had gone to Harvard, who was getting passion to help girls and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams, my dreams and how my dreams and why.
<unk> believed in me, as a woman and as a woman, as a woman, she had been done before.
And it was so why the marathon at that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much importance for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk>
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now the last thing I wanted to do was I went out of New York and leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do trouble for your partner and so on, so I would like to leave you with my job, and I went together and I went together with it.
I had no idea that I was falling on a <unk> <unk> which was coming out of the head of a physical message, financial <unk> and psychological psychological <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to put the threat of violence to see how it works.
And here is where it comes to the <unk>
As we moved to New York City you know, you know, that place where you're supposed to go. I had to feel so confident that I bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk>
Another guy named he was under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said he needed those <unk> because of the trauma of the trauma that lived in the trauma room.
I needed to feel better.
But those <unk> actually were a message for me, and even though I never had all my hand, my life was already serious for every minute of every day.
The first physical attack that was five days was five days before our time.
They were seven in the morning and still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 year-old of my neck had come up and I put my girlfriend on my girlfriend and married me with him.
In spite of what it had happened, I was sure I was happy to live forever, because I loved it, and he also wanted to do a long time.
And I was very, very lucky.
I just had a very strong sense of self, and by the fact of making a family of my life.
It had been a different accident and I never really needed it.
I spent two times in our lifetime.
And the first time I was driving to a secret beach and I was <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that I spent several times against the <unk>
And then a couple of days later, driving back from our minds, and it was <unk> by traffic and I put me a Big Mac on the face.
<unk> followed one or two times a week for the next two years and a half of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only thing in this situation.
One of the three American women is a victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some time in their life, and the Center for Disease Control that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
So to come back to my question: Why do we <unk>
The answer is true.
I didn't know that he was dead.
Instead, I was a very strong woman who was a very strong woman with a deeply <unk> man <unk> and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk>
The other question that everybody does is: Why is it just not <unk>
Why do I do not <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the most sad question and painful that people, because we are, we know something that normally <unk> is incredibly dangerous for a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the <unk> of domestic violence occur after the victim has given to the relationship, after the relationship, then the <unk> already has nothing to do.
Other athletes include the <unk> even after the <unk> has become married, <unk> of financial resources and manipulation of the court system for <unk> to <unk> to the victim and their children, who usually are forced to spend time with the judges to spend time in their mother.
And we still continue to ask why we simply don't know.
I was able to go away because of a last <unk>
I realized that the man who loved it, he would have killed me if he had got it.
So I did.
I told it all around the world, to the police, to my neighbors, to my neighbors, and my family and family members and I am here today because all of you.
We have the tendency to <unk> the victims as the headlines like this. <unk> women <unk> <unk> <unk>
The question, "Why are you <unk>
For some people is a way to say "The guilt is by <unk> as if the victims <unk> <unk> <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of hundreds of stories of men and women who also learned that they learned that they learned a lot about what happened and that they <unk> their lives and their own lives and their own lives as <unk>
Because it turns out that I am a victim and a school of domestic violence very well.
I went back to <unk> with a <unk> man, and we got those three kids.
I have this black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to do is I would never go back to you -- I would have never seen it -- I put my head on my head in my hands of somebody who says I did.
At this point, just like you're thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> or <unk> but all this time, I have actually been talking about you.
I guarantee you there are a few people who are listening to me right now, right now, that are being <unk> or they were <unk> or they were <unk> they were <unk>
And the reason it might be to be affecting their daughter, to their <unk> to their best friend right now.
I was able to put my nice love to my particular love.
And I keep doing this today.
It's my way to help other victims, and this is my last question.
Talk about what you've heard here.
The abuse, only in the <unk>
They have the power to end with domestic violence, simply asking the light about it.
The victims we need all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of violence in the world.
<unk> the <unk> to the light by talking about it with their kids, their friends, their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of men as well and <unk> that they have a <unk> future.
<unk> the very early signs of violence to intervene in order to stop consciously, to stop the victims and show the victims of it.
And together, we can turn our heads and our tables and our families in the stratosphere and we should be.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Hi. I call it <unk>
To be honest, for 10 years.
And I feel like this moment is a good tension in the room because I should not have talked so much, but luckily, I brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first change of clothing on a stage of <unk> so you have a lot of <unk>
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but we will find out later on Twitter on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of going to change what you think of myself in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These are very <unk> less bad than I have to say.
The worst part is going to go through this lecture, because it's when you're going to make me happy, so you don't do anything while I covers my mind.
Very good.
Why have I done this?
It's been <unk>
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is very powerful, but it's also <unk>
I've changed everything you thought about myself in six seconds.
And in this picture, there was never a boyfriend in the real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that I <unk> the back and I put it back on the street.
Of course, with surgery or surgery -- like the one that I did two days for work, there are very little things that we can do to transform our way, which is, even though a lot and <unk> has a great impact on our lives.
So today, for me, to be brave for me, it's not.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model for you.
Because I'm a beautiful woman and white and white and in my educational sector, that's being a simple girl here.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always tell me about it.
The first question is, how do you get to be <unk>
And I always say, a <unk> I was discovered, but it doesn't mean nothing.
The real reason that I made this model is because I won the genetics, and I am the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're asking what this is?
Well, in the last centuries we've not only defined the beauty as health, youth and mystery, which we are biologically committed to <unk> we also have been associated with a high and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And that's my heritage <unk> I have known to be able to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now showing you, and maybe there are some <unk> of the fashion that <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> to know so much about it.
But then I have to tell you that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from New York told each and every one of the models in the <unk> and of the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- I mean, less than four percent, were not <unk>
The next question that people always do is to do it to me to be able to be able to do it.
And my first answer is, I don't know, I don't know. I don't know.
But then what I really would say to each one of these girls is: Why? Why can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the right Internet, or one of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> which would be amazing that you would be the first.
If after this list, I still have <unk> but no, no, I want to be model, then I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> of the American magazine or the <unk> <unk> or the <unk> <unk>
To say that the biggest thing you want to be model is as to say you want to win the lottery when you're greater than you.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a work that you can do.
I'm going to show you everything I learned in 10 years as a model, as a model of surgery <unk> can be solved.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've already taken your studies, and you have a <unk> and you have a <unk> and you don't matter what you want, you don't matter what you want to be president of the United States, but your <unk> would be president of the United States, but your <unk> would take off.
The next question that people always do is if all the photos were <unk>
And yeah, you know, all the photos, but that's just a little part of what happened.
This was the first picture that I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know that we're entering the personal direction.
And so I came up with my grandmother a few months ago.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came up with me.
Here in a <unk> party -- a few days before the pictures for the <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in the movie.
And this is me.
And I hope you realize that I'm not me in those photos.
These are <unk> of a <unk> group of <unk> photographers and <unk> and <unk> and all their <unk> and people of <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this.
Well, the next question that people always do is it makes me <unk>
I have a lot of <unk> <unk> and I never hear it, except the couple before, but the <unk> that I get are the ones I get in the real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and I talked to me about taking money, and they gave me the job.
When I was a teenager, I would travel with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> stood up in red and of course, and of course, and of course we were <unk> one of my favorite agent <unk>
<unk> of these <unk> by my way, not because of what I'm talking about, and there are people who are paying a price for their aspect of their aspect of their lives.
I live in New York, and last year of the <unk> teenagers who come up with a couple of black holes were black were black and <unk> and most of them were young people.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
But how many times I am <unk>
When I investigate this talk, I learned that by 53 percent of the girls in the United States who don't like their body, and that can be <unk> to <unk> percent of the <unk>
So the last question that people do is, how is life of a <unk>
And I think the answer is that if you're a little bit more thin and you have the smaller hair and you have the most brilliant hair, and you feel very happy and forth.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe we can do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to go, and also incredible power to work with creative people and <unk>
And that's true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them is, I am a <unk>
And I'm because I have to worry about my aspect of life.
And if you ever say, with a little bit more positive, and a more brilliant hair and a more brilliant hair will be more difficult.
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most brilliant legs of the <unk> hair and the most brilliant clothes and clothing -- but probably the most likely women in the planet.
But especially it was hard to look at a situation of <unk> and gender when I am one of the greatest <unk>
If there is something to be done by this talk, I hope that all of you feel more comfortable to recognize the power of the image in the perception that we have about success and failure.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since it was the most powerful enough to get a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 photos -- and I didn't get the <unk>
There was no doubt that there was no opportunity to <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even a lot of care at all.
In fact, most of them were <unk>
My story begins when, you know, <unk> in the city of New York to give me a <unk> my wife told me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of the slide.
I happened to go back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When I was the third birthday birthday party my wife told me, why don't you take you to <unk> to New York in a <unk> trip to the <unk>
Here is when we started asking them to ask them that they were going to be the picture.
It is amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has ever heard of, and luckily, never has never been <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life works.
It became something sacred to us.
This picture is about a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter that I had happened that day so that a little girl could do it.
These pictures are much more than representations of a concrete moment or a very specific time.
It's also a way to stop the time in a week of October October of October and to make us think about our time and our evolution over the years, and not just as physical as it is.
Because, while we always take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter becomes new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how it feels and interact with everything.
That time in concrete that we spent together is something that we hope with this whole year.
Recently, at one of the <unk> we were going down, and we were taken off when all of a sudden, and pointed out a red <unk> and a red <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And he described it as a sense of the five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> who remembered his heart <unk> with the force to see that place for the first time for the first nine years.
And now what you look at in New York is universities, because it's really determined to study in New York.
And so suddenly I understood that one of the most important things that we created is the <unk>
So I want to share with you the idea of being inspired by the conscious creation of life.
And I don't know you, but apart from these 15 photos, I don't know in many of the pictures they have.
I am always the photo.
I want to encourage you to come up in the picture, and I don't know how to go back to someone and do it.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The <unk> are in the <unk> group of <unk>
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It also has been associated with technological breakthroughs as well.
More recently, if you've been following the press --  -- <unk> <unk> and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament -- but I don't want it.
I don't know.
Because members of Parliament are not <unk> the environment.  The <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>  They're far away from <unk>  And my favorite favorite --  -- you have a better job.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of New World who are mostly in <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the United States, where we have 16 species.
So why do the <unk> are <unk> First of all, they are <unk>
They're our <unk>
And I said, <unk>
They need to kill all of the bacteria that are actually going to absorb the pulse that it won't be for them and have huge loss of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Now, studies have shown that in areas where there is no <unk> they take three at four to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge amounts in the spread of disease.
The <unk> also have enormous consequences.
They've been associated with ancient culture.
<unk> was the symbol of <unk> and <unk> and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the <unk> and the <unk>
In the emergency room. I was the god <unk> and I managed to learn their life to save the <unk> of the Tasmanian devil <unk>
In the culture of <unk> you get a very important <unk> to open up straight in places like SUNY <unk> there's no place to send the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a system of elimination natural gas.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, in which six of them are in the opposite direction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical list, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years it will be <unk> and the reason is because they have been treated with a drug <unk> like the <unk>
This drug has been banned by use in India, in India and they've taken a lot.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread of <unk> dogs in <unk> <unk> and when you have <unk> <unk> you have a huge pump of time to <unk> the number of cases in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest parks in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be the top of the <unk>
I'm not against wind power, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines are doing this at the bottom, and they do it by half.
They're <unk>
In Africa, there is a horrible trade trade trade to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market of <unk>
So what are you doing? Well, what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these <unk>
We're trying to determine its basic ecology and see where they are.
We can see that travel around all these different countries, so we focus on a daily problem.
We need to work with governments in the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about how to appreciate the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can we be able to do that? It can become assets, they can write a letter to their government and tell you that we have to focus on these very <unk> <unk>
When you go out of this room, you're going to report on the <unk> but you talk with your families, with your neighbors on your neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed from opinion because he was able to fly with no energy spending in the world.
Kenya, this world will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Many thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Every thing I do and everything I do with my life has been <unk> by seven years of work for my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> a young man, but I don't know what I'm talking about,  I worked in Kenya, South Central Kenya, <unk> and <unk> projects of technique with African countries.
We worked for a nonprofit venture and every project we set up in Africa <unk>
And I was <unk>
It was going to come to the New York Times, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that <unk>
So our first project, which I inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where I was a one of them, and we decided to teach the people of the United States.
So we came up with seeds <unk> in South Africa to this absolutely wonderful valley that led to the river <unk> and we teach local people growing tomatoes and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And of course, people weren't at all interested in doing that, so what they were going to do was to come to work, and sometimes they were not <unk>  We were able to <unk>  We were able to do it in so large valley, that was not had to go.
However, instead of asking how it was possible that we didn't know anything about it, we simply said, "Thank God that we are playing with God to save the people from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was <unk>
We had these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a place to grow up to this size.
And we couldn't believe that we were saying that we were saying to the <unk>
When tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> came from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> they said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here.  "Why don't we do it."
I thought that only we would call <unk> <unk> in Africa, but then I saw what they did the Americans, what they did the it, what they did, and then to see what they were doing, and then to see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project at all.
Because, you see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> to see the <unk> --  -- you know, you see the waste that you get to the <unk> people of Africa.
It wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in the 1950s.
We, in Western countries, we've delivered the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that the money has been.
I just read his book.
<unk> part of a woman -- the damage that we've done since we've done a lot of time.
The Western West are <unk> <unk> and we treat people just like two things: or the <unk> or we are <unk>
The two words come from the <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
However, two different things.
<unk> I try to deal with any of a different culture as if they were going to get my children.
<unk> I try to deal with all of a different culture as if they were <unk>
So the white in Africa are called <unk>
And that book gave me a <unk> in the face, <unk> <unk> written by <unk> who said for the entire development of economic development, if people don't want to be <unk>
It should be the first principle of the future.
The first principle of help is <unk>
This morning, Mr. <unk> this conference was put up on the ground and said, we can be able to imagine a city which is not <unk>
I decided to leave 27 years just to answer people, and invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never end up on anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passionate <unk> the local <unk> the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what does it mean?
But it gets us to a community with an idea, and it sits with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from it.
We sat down in a chair, and we met in a <unk>
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do when we become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
the most important thing is the passion.
You can give you an idea to me.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do it?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important.
The passion that you have for your own personal growth is the most important.
And then we help them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but the knowledge is important.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: why don't we have this idea: why don't we ever get to a community to tell people what to do, why don't we do it for once, for once, but not in meetings, <unk>
I'm going to tell you a lot.
There is a problem with this.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they never tell them in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity they have to do with their own money.
So planning has this point.
For the most intelligent people in their community, you don't even know the Nigeria, because they don't go back to their family.
What we do we do is we work on one to one, and we work with face, you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn't exist.
You must create a new experience.
The profession is the family doctor in the company, the doctor of the business of the business of the business of the business, and at the table of his kitchen, in the coffee, and that helps to find the resources to transform its passion in a form of <unk> life.
I started this as a test on <unk> city of Australia in India.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get out of this television.
In a year, I had 27 projects where the government came to see me and said, "How can you do that? How can you do that?
And I said, "What can I do?" And I said, "I really did something very, very hard.
I was <unk> and <unk>   So the government says, <unk> <unk> <unk>  We have done 300 communities in the world.
We've helped us to start 40 business.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of <unk>
So Peter <unk> one of the most compelling leaders of the story, died at the age a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> called "The <unk> <unk> <unk> is actually advising a society and an economy of <unk>
The planning is the kiss of the <unk>
And so now we can do that, so we have to know what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn to get these people to come to talk to you with you're going to talk to you.
You have to say to you that you have to be great to be fantastic to <unk> and then you will go back to <unk>
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 dollars?
You can imagine a community of 400 people, intelligence and <unk>
What you have to do is you have a <unk>
People <unk> this is what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the <unk>
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossil industrial revolution could not renewable energy, and of one moment to each other, we have systems that are not enough.
The internal engine is not sustainable.
The <unk> as a form of <unk> isn't it?
What we need to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technology.
Who is going to invent technology for the revolution, <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
You get the entrepreneurs and they are doing it now.
There is a <unk> story that I read in a magazine, many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to teach the future of New York in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> we met this group of people. And <unk> about what was going to happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> the city of New York City, there were no <unk>
Why? Because we looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is growing up in this <unk> to move to the population of New York to get the population of New York to <unk> six million dollars' worth of <unk>
They were already <unk> in <unk>  So in <unk> they were <unk> this <unk> technology that <unk> the life of New York.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in America, in the United States, <unk> companies are <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in places like <unk>
<unk>
However, there is a secret to work with <unk>
First, you have to find <unk>
In another way, I will not come to you with you.
And then you have to find a all, right?
And <unk> you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company -- the larger company -- it has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell to you have to be great, you have to tell you with a fantastic <unk>
You know what?
We have known a single human being in the world that can be done, to sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not true.
So we've looked at this, and we looked at the 100 major companies in the <unk> world <unk> <unk> <unk> all the new <unk>
There is only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common in common in common -- was a single person.
But the word <unk> but the word <unk> but the word <unk>
He was not only when he was born.
Nobody starts a alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business of small business <unk> in <unk> along with their <unk> who will do for you, what somebody did for this gentleman talk about this gentleman who talks about this <unk>
What can we do now?
Well, it can be <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do this."
We activate communities.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
These are all around us, we can help us with many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't have a lot of knowledge despite all the same places.
In the last few years, I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk>
These projects came from questions like, "How much do you pay my neighbors for your <unk>
How can we pay more and more things not to call more things not to call the door <unk>
How do I share more memories of our buildings and to understand better our <unk>
How do I share more of our hopes for the cows and the cows so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York City and I'm <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant rivers that give shadow of <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and <unk>
It always leads to music --  there is a <unk> in New York --  The city has one of the most beautiful things in the world, but also one with the largest amount of <unk>
I live near this house and I thought how it could turn into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009 I lost somebody who loved somebody else.
It was <unk> like a mother for <unk>
It was his death was sudden <unk>
I thought a lot about death and death and so on.
And this led me a profound faith for the long time.
He gave the significant things significant in my life.
But I was able to keep this looking in my own life.
It seems to me that it's easy to catch up for the day and to forget what really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends come up with the wall of this broken house on a giant board and I painted on her phrases to <unk> "Before she would die of <unk>
So the <unk> could take a look at their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment but the next day, the next day I was filled with and I kept <unk>
And I would like to share some things that people wrote in the street.
If I die from dying for <unk>  Brown, I want to sit in the line of <unk> on the line of <unk> in the <unk> line of <unk>
And then they die from dying for millions of years.
And then I want to get to plant a <unk>
And then I would die from dying of the <unk>
And then they die from dying once again.
And then they die from dying of <unk>
If I would die from dying -- I want to be completely wrong.
This space itself became <unk> and the dreams and hope and hopes of people made me laugh at me -- and I was given it to me, and they gave me a role.
It's about to know that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it's about giving it to the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what the most important thing for us as we call and <unk>
And this happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of people who wanted to do a wall in their community community.
And so with my colleagues in the <unk> center, we did a kit and now have been covered in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and over there.
And together, we showed the power of our public spaces if we give us the opportunity to understand and share with them.
Two of the most valuable things that we have are the time and our relationships with other people.
In our process, we are more importantly, it's more important than ever, to find the ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is short and different.
The death of the death is something that often I often do -- or even think, but I understood that I came up with the death of death is one of those things that I would say.
So thinking about the death of the <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as a community and with more media and more media and stories, the people around us cannot only help us improve people's lives.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Today I have a single one.
Please let me tell you that I'm right.
Now I'd like to introduce to my friends.
<unk> has 22 years old, it's high and very powerful.
Not speech, but it makes joy better than some of the best things.
<unk> knows what the love.
So what does it mean?
It's not <unk> I don't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and pay for this.
When I read songs from our childhood, trying to make words that I didn't even know -- I remember one thing: the little thing that we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that must be the same.
Had 16 years ago, it's high.
<unk> the more <unk>
But it's a good thing.
It doesn't tell me if I liked my <unk> but remember the year that came out every single one of my iPod, conversations that came out when I was four years old, I got it in my arm during the first episode of <unk> and the birthday party <unk>
It doesn't look like this.
But most people are not <unk>
And in fact, because their minds are not represented by the concept of society, often are <unk> and <unk>
But what he propelled me to my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even if you didn't consider it inside of it, it could only mean one thing: I could just mean one thing: they were <unk>
Now, for those of you who are less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social media, learning and sometimes <unk>
In each individual in a different way, there is a different way of getting <unk> to be so different to me.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, will be able to be a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the disorders of the development of the developing world, there is no cause or <unk>
I don't agree with my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I had just three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new being in my life.
When you spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> <unk>
I didn't want to play a game like the other babies and, in fact, it didn't seem very interested in anything.
<unk> living and <unk> in their own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the most small things, like putting cars on line around the room, looking at it in the room, and they eat anything that would have been among us.
As I was born, it became more different, and the differences were made more sense.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a perfect nature and a child, a child who saw the world without having a human life that had never happened.
We were able to do it.
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments in which I would have been just like I was just like me.
But I look back at the things that have been taught me about my colleague, and the love, and I realize that are things that I wouldn't want to change by it.
And it's going to happen at high level of the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any is wrong.
It only means there's a different vision of what it's right now.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and to you, and to you, it would be that you don't have to be like.
You can be happy.
Because, if autistic or not, the differences that are <unk> are a <unk> each one of us has a gift in its inner place, and honestly, the pursuit of happiness is the last cause of nature.
So the opportunity for the environment and the change is in the moment where we try to be like the other.
So I don't say I'm not going to tell you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what it must have been to be <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State was asked to me, a science professor of communications, that I would give a kind of communication to students of engineering research.
I was born --  -- <unk> of these <unk> students with their great minds, and their big books and their big books and the <unk>
But by doing those conversations, I felt what was going on, there was no sense when he fell through the <unk> and saw the door of a new world.
And so I felt when I had these conversations with the students to tell me the ideas that they had, and I wanted other people to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great success.
We need a big communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are <unk> our largest challenges from energy in the environment and care in health care among others, and if we don't understand this, the work isn't done, and I think it's our responsibility as we don't have these <unk>
But these great conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, thank you.
I want to share some suggestions about how you can make sure that you can make sure that your science is sexy and that your engineering is it.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant for us.
It doesn't tell us just that we study the <unk> but we study the <unk> that are the <unk> structure of our bones because it's important to understand and try and try and figure out the <unk>
And when they're describing their science, they care with the <unk>
The slang is a obstacle to our understanding of his ideas.
You can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing.
Instead, as he said to Einstein, that everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
You can actually communicate his science without keeping ideas.
And something to consider is to be able to use stories, and they are sort of sort of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And when you present their work, the signs of <unk>
They have asked why they are called <unk>  What do they do <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> their <unk>
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it takes too much into the area of the language of our brain and the <unk>
Instead, this <unk> of <unk> Brown is much more complicated, showing that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that I really inspired the only design of the <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple phrase that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then then provide graphs that are <unk> to our other senses, and they think a deeper sense of understanding what it is.
I think these are just some key ones that can help others go to the door and see the country that is the country that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when they have solved this equation, for all media <unk>
One of my favorite words of all of my favorite words about all of us.
Just because it sounds very good.
And <unk> means <unk>
Although there was a <unk> editor of the 19th century that he made a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is the one that looks for a public charge without matter whether or not, and that when he touches it, and that when he wins, he takes it for a while.
I don't have any idea of what it means to be <unk>
One thing to do with words, is to do with words, right?
It is very important that the words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the story.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed the words to take the words that were told in the <unk>
And all this was due to the courage of a guy with the name of <unk> <unk> who was faced with <unk>
He had been able to get into the Science Museum, and he was <unk> but he had enough skills to deal with them, and at the end he had such popular support in London that he did.
And just a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most of you think it's true.
It's not. It's by an advocate of freedom of course.
But to show you how the words and politics are, I want you to go back to the United States right after the night.
So they had to tackle the question of how to call George Washington Washington, D.C.
We don't know.
How do you prefer the leader of a <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were faced with all sorts of suggestions that could have <unk>
Some they wanted to call the <unk> state of <unk> and others <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> of the U.S.
Not too much.
Some of you just wanted to call <unk>
It was that he was trying to figure out who he was.
And they didn't even know that they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen to be chosen by a <unk>
And there might be <unk>
All the world got married, because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper from a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What it caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of conservationists, I didn't want it to be <unk>
They didn't want to call it <unk> if they were just given to him or his friends.
And so they wanted to give the most expensive title and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And that title was <unk>
And he didn't invented it, he didn't invented it, but it was only meant to be <unk>
It was like the president of a <unk>
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were presidents <unk> of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a degree <unk>
And so the Senate is <unk>
It's a ridiculous thing to do.
"This guy has to sign treated and <unk>
"And who I would take in serious with a wonderful title and <unk> like President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate is not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things.
First of all, and this is my favorite thing to where I've been able to figure out where the Senate has never been.
President Barack Obama has lucky to follow there, hoping that the Senate between action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that as a government is <unk>  <unk> possible that we continue to continue waiting for years more.
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important thing and what I want to talk to you about is that the title of the United States doesn't sound at all as modest today, right?
And especially if you have over 5,000 nuclear heads to digitize the largest economy in the world and a fleet of solar vehicles -- and so on.
The reality and the story of the <unk>
So at the end of the day.
And he said, his title <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, the appearance of <unk> -- well, it was one side.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because you want to sound like the guy who has 5,000 nuclear gas.
So at the end of the New York Times won and the House of stakes, <unk> because no one is going to feel the wrong way when they tell them that they're the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and with which I would like to talk to you.
politicians try and use the words to shape and use the words to shape and control reality, but actually the fact that it actually changes much more the words than what they might change the reality.
Many thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I'm 45 feet below the ground in an illegal park.
The air is heat from heat and dust and it's hard to move.
I feel the touch of the bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk to you, but above all, that's the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> tools and <unk>
As the others, I carry a cheap flashlight of light on the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the branches of the branches of that hole from that hole in a meter that falls hundreds of feet into the land.
It was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met before he lost the control and dropped a hundred feet in that <unk>
And as I talk to you today, these men are in the deep nature of that hole -- their lives are not paying any reward and often <unk>
I went out of that hole and I went home and I went home and I probably never heard it because they are <unk>
In the last 28 years I was documenting over 70 countries on more than 70 countries in six continents and, in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the United States.
Among all of the incredible people I met there met in the United States of <unk> the <unk> a nonprofit who is involved to eradicate poverty.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was a world in the world but not even in the world.
And when we end up talking to me and I sat down and I said, "I was afraid to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't do it."
It was made me just like the stomach and weeks later, I flew in Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and the <unk>
So I started my journey to modern Africa.
Interestingly, there had been many of these animals.
In some, I thought my second home.
But this time, <unk>
A conservative social calculation says that there are over 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the amount of African Africans throughout the entire world.
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer was about about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker, a U.S.
The equivalent to a couple of <unk>
However, today it can be done by families for generations of <unk>
And finally, the slavery generates more than 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many of you have been involved with a lot of good education, and better work for then finding that they're forced to work with no threat under violence, and they can't be <unk>
Today slavery today is in the <unk> goods that are produced by slaves have value, but those are the ones that produce these things.
Life exists in almost everyone around the world and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India, and I've been able to share the world.
This strange show and <unk> was like getting into the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a <unk> temperature --  men, women, in fact, in fact -- in fact, families -- <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in their heads -- up to 18 to 18 at the time, and they take them out of <unk>
<unk> by the <unk> and the <unk> they work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 hours a day.
There were no coffee to eat, not to drink, and the <unk> I would do it was pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to touch and left with it.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make air conditioning out for <unk> and sitting there, and sitting there, I thought, "Oh, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
And back in the '90s, I wanted to hide it, but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly turned me into my side and said, "You don't do it, don't do it."
And he explained very clearly that I demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't find any money.
I couldn't give them any money.
I didn't know that country.
Could I put them in a worse situation that they already are?
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for its liberation and signed up in the <unk>
At the time of me, he invited home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found a little kids named <unk> <unk> for miles from <unk> to trucks that they expected to go.
Those big <unk> were more than the kids who were <unk> and children <unk> their heads with <unk> <unk> made by <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so far.
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they are born -- and they work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been so much their life.
They don't have anything to do.
When these <unk> <unk> their freedom, the <unk> they were kept on their own.
When you hear the word <unk> we often think of sexual traffic and because of this global awareness of the world that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously previously been previously previously been previously <unk>
It took me to a couple of stairs that were given to this <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
And it was more good for me.
<unk> as you know in the manuscript, are local and <unk>
They have small rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of that only seven -- are forced to the clients and they were forced to buy more food and alcohol.
Each one is dark and <unk> identified by a number of painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a <unk>
The nest maintenance workers often have sexual abuse to their children.
standing in the <unk> I remember having sense of an <unk> <unk> and, at that time, I could barely imagine what it should be going to be getting stuck into that training.
It was just a <unk>
There were no <unk>
There were no big windows like this.
These people don't have <unk> and because we have a very difficult issue so hard, it's important to point out that <unk> even sexual traffic happens to us around us.
There are hundreds of people who are <unk> in agriculture, in <unk> and the list can be <unk>
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 children and 300 children die every year as well.
And we don't see it.
People are another activity that they often engage with with their daily lives.
And I saw Indian villages in which there were whole families in the business of <unk>
This is a family.
The hands of black hands are the father, the <unk> of blue and the red, of its children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and produce silk in the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
And my grandfather told me their stories.
We don't have <unk>
We also hope that we can be able to go out of this house one day and go to another place where we really have to do our own.
It's been estimated that there are over 4,000 children <unk> in the lake -- the largest lake in the world.
When I was a kid, I was going to take a look at it.
I saw what seemed to be a family of fishermen on a boat, two older brothers and older kids, some more young kids.
<unk> were all different.
The kids are separated from their families, <unk> and they forced them to work on these boats in these boats in the lake, even though they didn't know it.
This child has eight years.
When our boat came to his boat to his boat to his little <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of water.
The <unk> branches of the trees in the lake are often dependent upon networks and children, and with fear, they get to the water to deliver the <unk>
a lot of <unk>
Since remember, it has always been forced to work on the Web.
For me, I love her is not going to flee and, like all life has been treated with Joshua's sandwich?  This is to the younger kids.
I met these guys at the age of five in the morning, when I was <unk> the last networks, but they had been working since the last one.
At night and <unk>
And it was going to point out that these networks will become more than 400 pounds when they're covered with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
So Kofi Annan was in a village in Afghanistan.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> to victims of the <unk>
So we were able to do it.
Who will get to be because somebody decided to make a difference in their <unk>
<unk> by a road in Ghana with the <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his husband and her husband and <unk> our car and his car <unk>
He asked him to do it by a road to the <unk>
At the end of the way, we were going to go out of the car, and he asked the driver that it was there.
And then you signal this path just and said, "This is the way, this is the way.
As we began to go back to the <unk> that we <unk> the path and after walking around an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> and so I put the team on my head as I put up pictures of my head as it <unk>
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> he ended up in one of those of us, and we had a mass of holes in a mass of holes that could fit in a plastic field and they were all filled with <unk>
A lot of women had children in their hands, and as they were looking at gold, <unk> in <unk> <unk> with <unk>
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These were <unk> in a small part of the country.
When they came out of the well, they were <unk> in their own <unk>
I remember looking at his eyes tired, because many of them had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells are up to 90 feet and these people who are <unk> <unk> <unk> who then will be transported to another area where they <unk> the stone to get the decision.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look closer down, we see people working on other fortunate and also children.
All of those are victims and violence.
In fact, it is very likely that this <unk> led to the beginning of the T.B. and the <unk> in <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died his uncle took him to work with him on the ground.
By the end of his birthday, his uncle said, "You know, the debt of what the force is going to be produced in the <unk>
When I met him, I had worked at 14 years and the injury of the leg that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so that doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has T.B. and not yet yet it is forced to work night and day in that mine.
Even so, he did this with being liberated and <unk> with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and this is this kind of determination to a chance of face what makes me a lot of respect.
I want to leave you with a light on it.
Did you know that your images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that I'll give you testimony of them and we're going to do everything possible to help change their lives.
I think if we can see each other as human beings as humans, then it makes it very difficult to tolerate atrocities like that.
These images are not of people, and people are real people, as you and I, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no one day that I don't think of in these beautiful religious people, <unk> that I've had the great honor to do.
I hope that these images will be a force in which you see, in people like you, and I hope that by making that force on, a fire and that fire <unk> light on the slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to continue to live in the world.
Many thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I do mathematical math and there's a peculiar problem for whom the <unk> is like the <unk>
Nobody knows what the hell is.
So I'm going to try to explain to you today.
<unk> is one of the most human.
We were <unk> the <unk> of the poet and the <unk>
But the Netherlands, demand a degree of training -- a high level of skill -- and probably some of the initial <unk> that you can have a specific component that you can have a specific component that you can have a specific component that you can have a specific component that you can have a specific component that you can have a specific component that you can actually have a
Unfortunately, psychiatric disorders like the wrong of Parkinson's disease, gradually this amazing skill as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time was a <unk>
In the last few years, it has made a lot of money.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sitting there and they have to deal with a nonprofit venture pain, and other symptoms of this disease, so we need new tools before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately the only way we know if there is actually a cure to be when we have an objective reality.
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement of the movement there is no <unk> of blood analysis and the best we have is a <unk> exam for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very <unk> and that means that, out of the clinical trials have never been done.
And what if patients could do it in <unk>
That would save a trip to the <unk> What if patients could be able to do the <unk>
It doesn't really work.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars a day.
So what I want to talk to you about is what I want to talk to you about for a while, you see, in a certain sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk>
This is a video of the thumb of <unk>
It shows someone as a healthy sounds as I mentioned, and we can imagine how a dancers of a poet <unk> because we have to coordinate all those wireless organs to produce sounds and we all have the <unk>
And as a result, it requires a level of training to it.
Let's think of the time that it leads to a child learning to speak to me.
From the sound of the sound, we can track the position of nerves as <unk> and just like Parkinson's disease, it affects the <unk> it also affects the organs of <unk>
At the bottom of the bottom, you can see an example of an example of <unk>
We see the same <unk>
And the answer is yes.
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the <unk>
How do you compare these <unk> based on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, both are not <unk>
The <unk> test is not <unk> they're both using the infrastructure to use it.
It's not necessary to design a whole series of hospitals for us.
And both of them are <unk> OK, but in addition to <unk> it's not <unk>
I mean, you can be <unk>
They do very quickly, they get about 30 seconds as well.
They are <unk> cost and we all know what happens to us.
When something came out as a result of something like this.
These are some amazing things.
We can reduce <unk>
I wouldn't need to go to the clinic for the <unk>
With <unk> <unk> we could get real data.
We could make massive amounts of mass cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> to <unk>
We have the opportunity to start looking at the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when you give them the first steps in that sense, we're looking at the Great <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals and start to tackle these goals and start to tackle these goals and start to tackle these goals first.
We have local lines, accessible to each other, millions of people in the world.
<unk> or without Parkinson's or <unk> can call under the price and leave recordings for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already achieved that we've already reached 60 percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.  So I took all of these samples from taking all these samples of, let's say 10,000 people, you can say who you're healthy and who you are.
What about these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, well, what happens is that during the call you have to tell if you have or not the disease.
<unk> You see, some people can do not <unk>
But we're going to get a very big sample of data in different circumstances, and it will do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for the potential factors in search of confusion in the disease.
TR: You have a <unk> of accuracy in this way.
<unk> more than that.
Actually, my graduate student -- I have to <unk> it has done a fantastic job and now has shown that it works on the mobile phone network also, what we call the project. We have a 99 percent <unk>
So it's a <unk> and it's a <unk>
<unk> <unk>
TR: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
<unk> thank you.
Before the March of 2011, I did <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk>
We were <unk> in the darkness, in front of the windows and by the general, and so forth.
We do all of the <unk> models even more <unk> the perfect skin of the perfect skin and the perfect skin of the impossible, it possible to get us into the press all the time, but some of us are really artists and some of us are really artists with many of the images and the <unk>
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world -- the events that we have.
Shortly later, an organization called a <unk> organization called <unk> <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 12, I traveled to <unk>
It's a small village of fishermen in the <unk> of <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first towns in the world.
The water level of water made it more than 24 hours away from three miles away from three miles away.
As you can imagine, the people were <unk>
So we were hoping that they would use them and <unk> them.
<unk> <unk> We took the opposite and we left the houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We got tons of tons of fish and tons of fish <unk>
And we were <unk>
For weeks, the volunteers like your neighbors find things like your neighbors found things.
They found pictures and <unk> pictures and <unk> photos and <unk> cards and <unk>
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and <unk> to different places around the towns around <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures held a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
And as you get out of the wave, and to save their lives, they had to leave everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped to clean up the toilets of the Earth.
This place it turned out to be a place to be the place of the village where the <unk>
And we had the honor and I had the honor to do that day for me to wipe out the photos.
This was exciting and <unk> I had heard of the expression of the <unk> but it wasn't until I was going to go to my hometown that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years that they were still in the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking about it, how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do it.
So that night I went on Facebook and some of them, and the next morning the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive and positive and so I knew that we had to do it.
So we started <unk>
This was the first one.
I was not too <unk> but where the water was <unk> the face of the girl had <unk> with a lot of accuracy and <unk>
In other ways, that guy, I wouldn't have the side of her itself, and that would be so tragic to have the picture <unk>
With the step of time, they came up with a little bit more photos and they needed more photos and more <unk> so that I went back back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 days from 12 countries to help.
At the age of two weeks ago, I was 150 people.
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> to <unk> a neighbor of <unk> <unk>
Once in the week we put our scanner in the modern libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
So the time you get <unk> in <unk> is a different story, it depends on the <unk> of the <unk>
I could take an example.
It could be <unk> months.
This <unk> had to draw up almost to hand as a guide to the areas whose color and detail of the water was not <unk>
I took a lot of time.
The water destroyed all these photos in the ocean, covered with bacteria, even with the oil even with the entire time of time I get <unk> so it was a very important part of the project.
We couldn't see the picture unless it was dry and it would have been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky to hand.
We have to make the guide of a woman.
It's very easy to harm the photos of the <unk>
As he said once again, the leader of my group is like making a difference.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures had been sort of a relationship to the photos.
There were started to be <unk> she had come to realize that the <unk> even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and his own face would not have been able to be able to <unk> the images in a single photo of a single picture and <unk> the picture of the <unk>
When they put their photos together shared something about their story.
A few colleagues of his husband found the pictures on a fire station between the rubble, pretty far away from his house, but his colleagues said, <unk> <unk>
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the urge to close the barriers to the Internet.
She had to go into the water as the <unk>
Their kids, their children, not so small now, but their two children were in school in school.
One of them was trapped in water.
It took a week to find all his family and knowing that they were all <unk>
And the day you get your pictures like your <unk>
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that he could <unk> something that he could be able to find out of the past that I could remember the past day in March when everything in his life changed his life or was lost.
After six months in Japan where volunteers had joined together hundreds of them helped us to clean up the more <unk> photos -- the great <unk> -- the great <unk> -- the vast majority of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us get to 90 families hundreds of photos and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we really didn't spend more than a thousand of them in teams and materials, most of them to <unk>
We take photos of.
A picture is a picture of somebody or something, one place, one place, one of the other things.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we would like to do, but the first thing that we did.
So this was the project, to restore small pieces of humanity, to get someone out of the past.
When a picture of this room comes back to someone, it's a huge difference in the life of the person who is <unk>
This project also made a great difference in the life of the <unk>
In some of them with something bigger with something larger using something bigger using something that is not really important models of it.
In order to end this email I sent it to the day that I came back from Japan after six months.
As you can see, I could not avoid the people and the stories that I showed in the pictures on my hands.
One particular photograph with women from different ages from the grandmother to the little little girl to the small girl would gathering around a baby, and I was <unk> because a similar picture of my grandmother, my grandmother, my grandmother, my mother, and my daughter <unk>
In the whole world, all of our basic needs are the themselves, right?
Thank you.
<unk> we were inspired by awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an exhibition of just a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and look faster and see the world not a million or a billion frames per second.
I'm going to give you a new type of <unk> a new technique as fast as we can create videos on the light of light in the air.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using the body without using it, and really the idea of camera.
If I take a laser <unk> and I put it into a <unk> <unk> in a second or a second -- in various <unk> -- create a <unk> package of just a millimeter from just a second.
And that package of malware that was going to travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a football bullet that a common bullet could be.
If you take that bullet and this <unk> package and then <unk> in this bottle, how do you get those photons inside this <unk>
What's the aspect of light in the <unk>
Now, all this --  --  Remember that all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel on the light <unk>
But this video is 10 billion times faster so that you can see light in the movement.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research.  <unk> lots of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what is going on.
And the <unk> our <unk> goes into the bottle with a <unk> package that starts to <unk> and that, inside it starts to <unk>
Part of the light is going to go to the table, and we start to see these <unk>
Many of the photons are finally coming to the <unk> and then explode in various ways.
And as you can see, there is a air bubble on the right side.
In that time, the waves travel down at the table and because of the opposite of the top of the top of the bottle, after several years that the oceans are <unk>
Now, if you take a common bullet and you make it the same distance and you look at the same distance and you see it on a slow camera at about 10 billion times, how much they think it would take us to see that <unk>
And one of them is a <unk>
It would be a very boring movie --  from a single bullet in the movement.
And what do we do with it?
You can see the waves that are <unk> from the table, and from the wall of the <unk>
It's like <unk> a stone on a chip.
It is the way nature paints a picture, and he thought of a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes look a little bit.
But if you look at once a little bit more like this, you'll realize that, as the light hits the ground, it follows a little bit <unk>
Why? Because the <unk> is <unk> and the light flows inside its inside and comes back back after several years.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your heart, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is not going to have to be.
Why do we create this camera in <unk>
As a result, you know, if you take a picture of a little bit of light coming up very quickly.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the smallest exhibition -- so we just enter some light.
We sent that <unk> that package that <unk> millions of times, and we recorded one and again and again with a very <unk> and we took those <unk> data and the <unk> <unk> to create these <unk>
We can take all of those data in a different way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become huge.
And if a new future of a <unk> will allow you to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw something out of light on the door. They go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from the camera to the camera, and from the camera to the camera, and from the camera to the camera, and from the camera.
And where we could pull those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We already know.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in <unk> <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will come back to the camera -- but interestingly, in times in different times.
And as we have a camera that works on quickly, our <unk> has <unk>
It has very good resolution and can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also up to the hidden objects -- but we don't know what point corresponds to what happens.
By projecting a laser can actually record a picture of it, which you see on the screen, it actually doesn't have any sense, it doesn't have any sense.
But we would take a lot of images like this, tens of images, <unk> and we will try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object itself.
We will be able to see it.
This is our own.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> <unk> with what's going back on the curve, so that it's going back to the curve, and then we have things for the back of the curve, but we have things for us.
And we could look at survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the light of the dark windows on the open windows of the open windows or we could look for survivors or we could look for survivors or men.
Or we could build <unk> able to see the inside of the body, <unk> and the same thing for the <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood that is quite difficult, so actually this is a asked for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new tool to solve the problems of the next generation.
So as a result, he was a scientist, and he became the science in art, an art art room.
And I realized that all of the data that we collected and we collect every time it's not just for scientific reasons.
And to create a new form of digital photography with slow and code code of colors, create a new form of <unk>
And let's look at those <unk> Remember, the time between each one of those waves is just a few <unk>
But here it is.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these <unk>
The waves should move towards us.
What happens now?
It turns out that as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have <unk>
The order that the events occur in the world sometimes appears to be invested in the camera.
And we put the whole array of space on space and time, we can set up this <unk>
It's already time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can be <unk> and it gives you an individual intelligence.
With a mobile phone can make a crime against humanity in Iraq.
With a cell phone you can come to a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone you can record a song, I put it into <unk> and you're going to see it.
All of this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that time.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are <unk> in search of change.
This is the fall of <unk> Imagine if all of these people gathering it in a matter of change, you have a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who of them have a mobile phone.
<unk> <unk>
Raise your eyes.
So I would like to give you an example.
It's very much. Almost everybody today has a cell phone.
But today today, of my mobile phone, and how life changed life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> lines of information.
(Music: <unk>
Why is that information <unk>
Because in the summer of 2006 the Global Commission presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk>
This is that every single mobile phone company, every single Internet company, has to store a wide range of information from the <unk>
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to the <unk>
Who sends them a text to <unk>
And if you use the mobile phone.
All of this information is <unk> for at least six months, and to two years in his phone company or its <unk>
And in all Europe of Europe and said, "We don't want <unk>
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital era and we don't want the phone and the Internet suppliers from the Internet -- all this information about us.
There were lawyers, James <unk> and they said, "We don't want to be <unk>
And here you can see about 10 people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some even said this would be the <unk>
The <unk> was the secret to the New York Times.
And I also wondered if this really works.
You can store all this information about us.
Every time it is.
So I asked my phone phone phone that at that time, and I was the largest telephone company in Germany, which for please give me all the information you had about me.
And I asked them once, and then I went back to <unk> and I didn't have an answer. It was everything else.
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to <unk> a court demand because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, don't give you this information.
At the end of the day.
<unk> the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for the German law of the <unk>
So I got this picture on brown with a CD of a CD here.
And the CD had this.
So what about five billion <unk>
At the beginning I saw and I said, well, it's a huge one. Okay. Okay.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this country.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night, where I am here.
But then I said, I want to take this data.
I want to get public public health.
Because I want to show people what the <unk> of data.
So, along with <unk> <unk> and <unk>
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can go out and go back and start to go back and forth.
You can see every single step of it.
And you can see how I'm going to show you the <unk> and what I often call the <unk>
all of this is possible with this information.
that gives a little bit of fear.
But it's not only about me.
But from all of us.
First of all, there are things like, I call my wife and she says, we talk about a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call them a <unk>
And then you call the other, and the other one on the other side, and we end up with this big network of data.
You can see how their people relate to each other to know what time they call each other.
You can see all this.
You can see the paths of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society.
If you have access to this information, you can control their society.
This is a model for countries like China and Afghanistan.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who talks with who, who sent an email to who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is <unk> at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets of Berlin, at the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone.
And the <unk> there would be known as who I was on this conference, and if the <unk> would have known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The <unk> of the Berlin Times may never have happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today, the state agencies and business companies want to store so much information about us as possible in and outside of the world.
They want to have the possibility of keeping our lives and they want to <unk>
But the <unk> and living in the digital era is not a problem.
But today, you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for it.
When you go back home to your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century -- and it's not just been done yet.
When you go home, you get to their dreams that just because companies and military agencies can store some information, don't have to do it.
And if you don't think about your phone company, what is the <unk>
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones to remember that you have to fight for the <unk> in the digital world.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Anybody else? What happens?
It's not enough.
Anybody else? What happens?
I call it <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor I brought to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have a brain paralysis that's so <unk>
And so on.
It's crazy. I'm a mixture of <unk>
And <unk> <unk>
The C.
It's not <unk>
No one <unk> the <unk> of my mother and not the <unk> because my parents were brothers and friends.
It just happens by accidents, like the thing that happened to me.
Now, I'm not <unk> I'm not a <unk> and I don't want any of them to be there.
I feel bad for me, because at some point in life, I've been hoping to be <unk>
We're going to go away.
<unk> at Christmas, are in the medical center, drive in circles in search of parking parking lot and what we do.
16 places to come up with <unk>
And they're thinking, "Well, I can be at least a little <unk>
And then I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the C. <unk> is just one of them.
There is a <unk> of the <unk> I would get <unk>
I'm a <unk> woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I am a <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my illness had the same results.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York City.
Many people with brain paralysis are not <unk> but my parents don't believe in <unk>
This is my father --  -- you know, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three older sisters went to public school, my parents were <unk> the school system and they <unk> that I was also going to get out of it, and if we didn't take all the note from my mother.
My father taught me walking at the age of putting my <unk> in his feet and just <unk>
Another suggestion that I used was to take a dollar in front of me so that it was <unk>
The <unk> that I carry inside it was very strong and <unk>
Yeah. The first day in the garden of the <unk> was walking like a <unk> that has received a lot of it.
By growing up, there was only six Arabic in my city and were all of the family.
There are 20 <unk> and they follow all of the family.  I think no one realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and the politicians thought to be able to use <unk> to <unk> the <unk> as well.
The people who I grew up with did not have trouble with me.
But it seemed to be a lot of <unk> a lot of hunger in the <unk>
I told them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating a whole bunch of <unk> and so I went to <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford to pay the physical therapy so that they sent me to school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whether I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and we want to be <unk> so if my friends were using <unk> I as well.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer days on the coast of Jersey, I couldn't afford to.
I spent my year on a war zone, because my parents were worried that if we didn't go back to Palestine every day, all the <unk> were <unk>
In the summer days of my father I often tried to <unk> so I loved <unk> and I would sit down in front of me on the back of the back, and I remember going into the <unk> Sea <unk> and I remember the water and <unk> <unk>
But the cure was <unk>
I have to say it's very boring, but before I do this, I was a call from <unk> that I couldn't get out of.
And I can do it in the head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything with anything that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be in the <unk>
I went to college through the positive discrimination and I got a scholarship to the University of Arizona because I went into all the <unk>
It was like the <unk>
All of my work.
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I took the story in my mind, and also in their homes.
Every time I did a scene from <unk> <unk>
But I never got a paper.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a work called <unk> very slow <unk>
It's a work of a girl named <unk>
I was a girl with <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk>
I've got <unk>
At the end of the day.
Thanks to God in the end of the moment.
I didn't have the paper.  They gave it to <unk>
I went to <unk> I was running to the theater, crying out of the theater, crying as if somebody had killed my cat, to ask me why and she told me that because I thought I couldn't do the scenes of risk.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do scenes of risk, you can't do that.
It was a role for which they literally had been born and they gave it to a <unk>
I was doing my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disability for <unk>
When I went back home, and my first <unk> <unk> was like a <unk>
My dream was done true.
And I knew that it would be <unk> to <unk> friend of <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I was there as a <unk> and I didn't see it more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the United States of <unk> was not <unk>

But there was plenty of hope.
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common.
So I did it.
In my first tour of New York City to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first <unk> that led when he realized that he was going to high speed on the highway of New Jersey with a choice that had been <unk>
And I worked across memes, all over the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, but not in the Middle East.
Some people say I'm the first <unk>
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that you never heard that small rumor that says that women are not bad, and they find very well.
In 2003, my brother and my father's brother and father, Dean <unk> and I was launched by the <unk> <unk> of New York City, now in the year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and to remind the United States of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> to the Arabic was much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma in the future.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like I was invited to the news program on the news <unk>
And I went back to a <unk> dance <unk> to a study and they sat me on a wheelchair with me.
And I looked at it and I said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, four, three, four, and said, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I recognized at the desk of the <unk> to not go out of the screen for the <unk> and when the interview, I was <unk>
So I had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew that they didn't go back.
But not only Mr. <unk> came back to <unk> but he was like he was in my whole time and I pasted my chair.
Something fun that I learned in complete with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It is said that kids are <unk> but they never get rid of me and a little girl and a little girl and a little girl or a child.
All of a sudden, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
<unk> clips online with comments like, "Why do <unk>
Is it <unk>
And my <unk> <unk>
What happened?
We really ought to do it.
A few years ago, I even suggested that I would take my disability to my <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as the society.
If someone in a wheelchair could not do <unk> then then you can't do somebody in this room.
<unk> are -- yeah, <unk> <unk>
<unk> are the greatest minority of the world, and the more <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said that not <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
But of course having grown up with media, I don't think that <unk>
I hope that we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more images of positive images that are less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need all of society to teach our kids.
My <unk> journey has led me to a very short time.
I got to <unk> by the red carpet by the <unk> of the <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I got to act in a film with Adam <unk> and to work with my <unk> the incredible <unk>
<unk> the world <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> on a representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk>
And I founded <unk> children from <unk> a charity to give the children refugees to refugees a lot of what my parents were doing.
It was the only time my father looked at me in alive, and I asked him this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
And I call it <unk> <unk> and if I can, you know, you know, you know.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child in a small village of a small person.
I don't know your name, but I know your story.
She lives in a small village in the South Pole.
This village is about <unk>
<unk> <unk> to the small people and the edge of the <unk>
Without him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of <unk>
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, there are no jobs, no time.
He has just living in a hotel in the city of <unk>
After a year ...
One day, one day he said to me a little bit of <unk> then he was going to go to <unk>
It teaches a bunch of people, who gives you a <unk>
She gets a little bit of money to get a new clothes to send her new money to send her home, her family.
I told him a little bit about it.
We finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has an objective of life.
So a beautiful day in <unk> under a blue blue tree, we put a car together.
That child from that small village with the great city of the great city was the <unk> and that <unk> group of people were in the <unk> an <unk> organization with the <unk>
So how the story of a small child in a small village trying to get their dreams in the city of the city of the city.
He was <unk>
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start their future, waiting a future, and this was the first thing that I did.
This was the first thing that we called what we call "the <unk> <unk>
And his story is that in urban centers around the world.
This is the story of the <unk> young young people who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in London, to look at something beyond <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity for the opportunity, but the young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It is often the youth that have been on the highest rate.
By 2030, three of those five people who live in cities will be less than 18 years old.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them access to the <unk> story of <unk> the door of access to violence, to violence to violence, they will be the story of cities.
And in my city, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
And 70 percent is not going to work.
They don't do nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> <unk> the hospital where I live.
I remember being at that hospital, <unk> <unk> thinking, and if I never saw it.
And if I had seen myself in that same <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure of the answer.
And the reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to train some young leaders at a high school.
<unk> to about 90 leaders ...
And we sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to great challenges that face the city.
One of the young people in the room were <unk>
He was at the University of <unk>
He had no idea.
I remember when he said to me, because because of it was a graduate graduate student -- she was the white man for Al <unk> and other organizations were terrorists, to be <unk>
They were people like him.
But this story takes a different way.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to the point is to get out of the point -- it's the <unk>
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the most easy way of <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and the <unk>
It started a <unk> company.
It started to be turned upside down to local residents who they normally couldn't see.
He bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this important?
What does this mean?
I think its ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's <unk> <unk> and I think the corporate spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
<unk> to young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be happy.
I want to talk to you about a young man who walked to one of my graduate students to visit a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the top of business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of innovation.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that we <unk> has seen over 22 years, and until recently, until recently, we were looking at the <unk> if you wanted to get flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were sent out by <unk>
If you put yourself into someone, you saw it was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war.
So he saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk>
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and began to grow <unk> and <unk> that they could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And it began the delivery of flowers for you, creating them in the houses, and the business of the city, and now it's working in the creation of the first public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
It means to create a space where the families, young people, can go together, and, like he says, <unk> <unk>
By the way, he doesn't take care of it.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of phytoplankton, had a really profound impact on the young age.
They had never thought about a business.
They had thought to work to work for the government, to work for government, but their history, actually had a strong impact on them.
They forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
encouraged encouraged encouraged to believe that they could be diagnosed with change.
By the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the major challenges that face the city.
<unk> solutions for social problems.
So, to inspire young people and create a business culture is really a big step, but the young people need to use their ideas to make their ideas to make their ideas.
They need experience and <unk> to <unk> in the development and put them into their business.
<unk> the young people with the resources that need, <unk> the support that they need to go out of the universe, and create <unk> for the growth of urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something that will start a business.
It's creating social impact.
Once, it's not just selling those.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Yellowstone National Park is how it's called, when it's called, when it's based on the way that people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the <unk>
They gave them the opportunity to escape from the <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, to become young people in general, <unk> and <unk> their <unk> and they will have more stories about flowers and <unk> of the press that <unk> and <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I had about 10 years and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains -- a <unk> area in New York City.
It was a <unk>
<unk>
The sun was made by the leaves as a <unk> and not being on the way that <unk> we could almost pretend that we were the first human beings in the world.
We got to our lab.
It was a <unk> <unk> with a beautiful lake -- when I discovered something like this.
According to the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four feet with heart attack, and <unk> paper balls and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too impressive, as to get what they had <unk> who thought they were going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed me, and it was <unk>
Who clean our <unk>
Without <unk> or where they <unk> the <unk> who clean our trash into <unk>
Who clean our garbage in Rio or in Paris or in <unk> or <unk>
Here in New York City, the Department of clean clean clean water -- at least 11 tons of waste -- and two tons of products -- every single day.
I wanted to know as individuals.
I wanted to understand who that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and bring that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
And I went on the trucks and walked by their values, and I interviewed people in offices, and in all the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed more.
So I started working as <unk>
Now I'm not just going to travel in the room.
And the <unk> <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing experience.
<unk> <unk>
It's there, but it's not just as much as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong -- you get <unk>
It costs a lot.
I met people who had been working on it for several years and their bodies were <unk> the weight of the weight of the garbage <unk> all the weeks.
<unk>
According to the <unk> Office of <unk> <unk> <unk> is one of the greatest <unk> of the country, and I learned about reason.
You're coming out and coming back into the traffic all day and they go around.
You just want to <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also the garbage in this room is full of dangers that often fall from the walked and they created a terrible thing.
I also learned about that.
When you get away from the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the garbage is like a force of nature in it.
I never stop there.
It's also kind of like a <unk>
It should always be in the movement.
And it's also the same.
It seems that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the <unk> <unk> are the most important work in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
These are the first cars.
If you don't <unk> in the operating room and effective every day, this starts to <unk> out of their <unk> and their dangers are made in very real ways in real time.
We had been controlled by decades and centuries and centuries of <unk> and they start to <unk>
And the economics of the economy.
If we can't get rid of the old <unk> we don't have space for what the engines of the economy start to do when it's in danger of the economy.
I'm not kidding by capitalism, I just show its <unk>
And then it is what I call our average size.
So I just like to just just just just just at the speed of you that you see.
We don't even know what we do and we have to do with ourselves or we take our cup of coffee, our bag of water.
The <unk> we forget about them, because we know there's a force force on the other side that you take out of it.
So I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the waste <unk> that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable city and human society.
Her job, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every single day.
They use a uniform in many cities.
You know what?
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a way of thinking.
The flow that they keep us out of our own ourselves, of our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow will always stay in a way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a <unk> truck on the street, grabbed my little kid and put the stairs down and put the stairs on the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of paper as it did all the time.
And I tried to thank her for making his job in particular, but I started <unk>
And I looked at me and just said, "We're going to be fine.
We're going to be wrong.
Shortly after that, I started looking at the waste of waste and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we worked together many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk>
We're going to be right.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species as species we have to include and have to realize all the costs, even the very real human cost.
The genetic waste is what we think of when we talk about it, represent the three of the amount of waste in the country.
It's a remarkable number.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next thing you see someone whose job is to clean the trash from you, <unk> a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you very much.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking in our community -- being part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from the conditions and political traditions and political traditions of the world.
I brought today two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in developing countries, one in Ethiopia and the other place.
In addition to share the fact that the different analysis from different levels become an essential part of the actual work of architecture itself.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center of various ways in the capital of Ethiopia, including <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to do.
At first, the first thing he thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city that we realized there are three key aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost certain because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to use a lot of energy because the content with crystals generates heat on the outside, so it's necessary for a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it's about a climate change that goes 20 to 25 degrees for 25 degrees during the entire year.
And third, their aspect has nothing to do with Africa and with it.
It's a worth of a place as rich in culture.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really fascinated with the old market that is this structure of the air and the thousands of people, they go and buy things every day <unk>
It's also that idea of using public space to generate physical activity.
So I thought, that it was what I really wanted to design, not to design a business.
But the question was how to build a modern building, from various ways by applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the sake of the site, which is located in an area of a long city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the picture, isn't it?
And in addition to two parallel streets that are not communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet from hundreds of meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets of the building.
And this is going to spread with an hour's <unk> which creates a space to the free air in the building that goes through its own way, the sun and the <unk>
And around this space we have applied the idea of the market with small business, that changes in every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how close to it?
I wanted to find a solution to the digital conditions to the world.
And I got to think about a similar tissue to a <unk> <unk> with <unk> to allow the air entrance to make it out of the air, but in a way.
We then focused on these beautiful buttons of the <unk> of the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry and this helped me model it.
We're building that with these little pieces of <unk> which are the windows that leave the air and light of a <unk> way inside the building.
This is <unk> with these small crystals that use light on the inside of the building to find the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince the developers because they thought it was not a business center, but it wasn't what they did.
But in fact, we all realized that this idea of the market was actually much more profitable than the commercial center, because in order to be more local and more local, there were more local results for them.
And also, the idea of the <unk> was much more economic not just because of the material compared to glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have it.
So we got certain savings in the budget that we used to implement the project.
The first was to think about how to get the power of energy to the building in a city where electricity is almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting <unk> on the ground.
And then under those panels we think of on the roof as a new public space with meeting areas of meeting and bars that make this country.
And these <unk> in the roof, which actually collect water for the <unk>
They wait for the early year, because we're going to go through the top of the building.
The second example is a master plan for 2,000 apartments and services in the city.
And to make a big project, the biggest thing that I have ever had, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also their environment, their tradition and the culture.
So for that analysis I put a special attention on the <unk> a thousand years ago that was surrounded by a whole wall with a whole bunch of access to <unk>
When I first went to place, the first design operation that we did was to expand the streets and creating 12 similar blocks in size and features to the ones that are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we have a few points in relation to the idea of the idea of the <unk> doors with lines, and this transformed the model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the plan.
I thought, what would the best shape for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural gas.
So I would put a framework that sure that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that it's almost like a combination of the European block and the city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then at the low plant, we have all the connections to the brain.
And it also responds to local standards that would set up a greater density in higher levels and a lower density in the water.
And it also sounds like this idea of <unk>
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project that is almost as likely to witness to the community that I would share with you in the lab.
It's where all the neighbors, can you go up and do activities, and do such activities like running a <unk> <unk> in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in developing countries where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the life of people changes to communities and economies at the same rate that they grow up in the same rate that they grow in.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions but <unk> which will enhance the relationship between the community and the environment and the environment, and that they have as target with people.
Many thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined up to our class. It was so silly, as you see all the new ideas.
It had huge amounts of hair and a little <unk> and a little <unk> and it was very strong for the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of announcement, until I was <unk>
One day I got a day after the school. It was a little afternoon, and I remembered in the bathroom of the <unk>
When the coast was the coast of Africa, I walked into the classroom, and I took the table from my teacher to college.
And then I did.
<unk> <unk> <unk> just a little bit, just a few weeks ago.
All right.  And I was trying to get to the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my others had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all of them on <unk> and I was just one of them, just to be there, because I was going to be there.
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt great.
I don't understand why I never know.
It was all <unk>
I never did.
But over the course of the time, I was <unk> the reason I knew that this was so small, it was so good for me.
I was <unk>
They're so <unk> and so forth.
We know that babies are <unk>
We also know the birds are.
We know that <unk> are the number one <unk> one of those <unk>
And yet, I've never seen a study that we <unk> or the long duration or the <unk>
So you have to go to fiction, because they're all like the lab in the lab when you study them in all their possible ways.
And in fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no case.
Well, there would not be <unk> <unk> nor would it be <unk>
He would have no <unk> king and a <unk>
I didn't have it.
<unk> the lists on the high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> or <unk>
Without it, there is no <unk> I know that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the universe almost every day, almost every day.
This year at the age of 100 years of his favorite work, "In search of time <unk> the most <unk> study of the sexual <unk> and also the <unk> <unk> all we could do.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details of <unk> right?
We think in a kid trying to reconcile the dream.
We think of a <unk>
We forget about how long it is that image.
We forget about it.
That is to say, it's about books that are <unk> said they were as tough as <unk>
I don't know how the cat, but we assume that it's <unk>
Let's see why they're so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk>
It's going to be very obvious that the 99" is going to reduce the person, to your desire, to your <unk> are a good narrative of <unk>
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
When we feel dumb, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they are designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
Being aware of it, and we know exactly what the details of the details are <unk>
The <unk> us make us all Jon <unk> and that's something that <unk>
Everything that she does for me to give me pleasure could give me pleasure to the other.
And it starts to be said to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every little bit of it is cool that we would <unk> it in his career, it adds up to his collection of instruments of torture in his own country.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were <unk>
You know, the <unk> of <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a work.
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> of the information.
The <unk> are using it.
At <unk> they like the big hair, and the nice hair and little <unk> of <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of the photos.
It's so <unk> it's so successful --  -- <unk> the language of <unk> with the <unk>
When <unk> is in his knee, he's sitting behind the doors of the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his <unk> so it was the same.
He says, "Look, I know that this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an ancient text or to look at a <unk>
He says, "It's like a real scientific research <unk>
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> are <unk> and they make us seem to be <unk> but in their <unk> they're search for knowledge of the truth, a real <unk> in fact, in fact, the most painful <unk> the most painful the truth better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> these were the <unk> and the <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need to do, it causes us to persuade us about us a much more profound and more profound feelings and vital that a wise man who can be <unk>
It's telling us that we're going to look at women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> are reveal us to ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that we're going to do <unk>
There's some other emotion that we <unk> our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Some other emotion that we're working on to look at is going to look like this.
Freud would write about this over time.
One day, Freud was moved by a young man very <unk> who was born with the idea that his woman was born.
And Freud said that there was a strange thing in that man, which was not <unk> in what he did their job.
Well, she was <unk> everyone in the world.
The poor creature was under 1,800 dollars.
But he was looking at things that his wife, <unk> <unk> behaviors were <unk>
<unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious of his face.
<unk> are very good at this.
And they talked very well about how the <unk> they do to look at their intensity but not <unk>
In fact, the more many <unk> we are, the more we have become the residents in the world.
And for this reason, I think, the <unk> us get us to make us the <unk>
The <unk> are going to be very <unk>
Now I'm thinking about myself at eight years old, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman from Michigan came from 52 years old, he was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook from which you put a little bit <unk> out of it, for a year.
During a year.
She was trying to <unk> to the new girlfriend of his former <unk> I have to say that when I or this, I went to <unk>
Because, let's be happy.
What huge even though <unk>
It's like <unk>
Like a novel language.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She is a very brilliant character of the American literature of the American literature.
It's the <unk> of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> <unk> books that try to make our minds, and once we are in the realm of the sphere, in the kingdom of the universe, the membrane is what it might be, can be <unk> in a <unk>
Take Tom <unk> his favorite character over the last 20 years.
Tom <unk> is going to <unk> or want to do what you have to do with your being and to <unk> what you're ever <unk> and it's under the ground, you get to your name, <unk> your <unk>
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the path of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all the way to the world, as long as possible.
It's a trick, because we live in times of life.
We live in <unk>
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the coin is the <unk> right?
And they show us <unk>
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not safe, when they're in a <unk>
Let's go to the <unk> of <unk> Street and <unk>
When people think about <unk> you think about the <unk> of Professor <unk> of the <unk>
But I've always been interested in <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> which needs to be <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius of <unk>
And here's me as <unk>
<unk> needs to make their help, but it <unk> and <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in the <unk>
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the gorilla <unk> once <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and says, "We are not <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says there is no one person in <unk> <unk> who would not want to <unk> your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> <unk> in history, and it seems to me that this scene also has a lot of <unk> right?
It seems to treat the <unk> as a problem.
You know, in a minute <unk> is the opposite side of it.
The next minute you're on the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> it allows this idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so easy.
What if the <unk> are really a question of just a question of where we allow us to be able to be in relation to the world?
Well, maybe we don't have to be <unk>
We can <unk>
But I like to <unk>
So while we hope that as that happens, let's remember that we have fiction for <unk>
<unk> fiction <unk>
The fiction used to be <unk>
And look what we would like to look at the simple <unk> the scary Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the <unk> <unk>
We are in trouble.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21 of July in 1969, by 1969, the <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> on the top of the <unk>
Armstrong and his own <unk> were -- but its presence on the surface of the surface of the surface of the Earth.
And the program went down the program for a long time of peace in the U.S.
So to get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal government.
And he gave about 200,000 people and asked about 20,000 people and asked about 20,000 universities and government agencies and government companies.
And the people on the street.
But before the program <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, which was taken after death by the last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
It didn't spread a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 years later, a new sense of <unk> and the enormity of our common home is not <unk>
Why do <unk> <unk> <unk> is because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better understand.
But the <unk> words at Cambridge University in <unk> give us a better idea.
John <unk> Some people ask me why the <unk>
Why turn it into our lives?
And they could also ask, why would we scale up the <unk>
Three years ago, why fly over the <unk>
Why do <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they are ready but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> for the <unk> he was not just a victory in the West about the World War II in the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> of the <unk> of technology.
They were because it was a great thing.
On the moon on the moon in the moon in a long list of time.
And the first half of the 20th century produced the line of <unk> and the plane, the penicillin and the vaccine for it.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and the <unk>
The technology seemed to be able to do what they wanted.
For most of the history of humanity, we could not go faster than a horse, or a boat with Robben Island, but in 1969, the <unk> <unk>
Since 1970, no human has become the other.
Nobody has traveled faster than the following 10, 10, and the optimism of the optimism on the power of technology has been <unk> when we imagine that we imagine that technology would be able to go to Mars, create a clean energy or to feed cancer or to feed the world population seem to be <unk>
I remember looking at the <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't get to the tube tube that I did in the rocket rocket it.
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission -- but I was completely safe to see the colonies on Mars.
And so that's what happens to our ability to solve problems with the <unk> has become a common place.
We heard all the time.
And we've heard over the last two days here.
It seems like the technologists would have been <unk> and they were represented with toys like <unk> and things like <unk> and social networks, or algorithms that are getting <unk>
There's nothing wrong in most of these things.
They've expanded and calculated our lives.
But not <unk> the great problems of humanity.
What does it mean?
There is a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have been created less ambitious than the years of the years that we were <unk>
Silicon Valley is that the markets are the same, but the incentives that have the risk of risk offer to the Internet.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused that to be <unk> the creation of ideas -- for the funding of problems -- or even basic problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong with <unk>
Even when the risk of risk were at the end point not to worry about risk, they'll cut small investment, small investment, you know, they could go out in 10 years.
The <unk> always have had trouble for investing in technologies as energy, which need a huge capital and whose development is all over the long term.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and different.
Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems.
We could go to Mars if we <unk>
NASA has designed a problem.
But go to Mars -- it would be a political decision that was popular and that never happened.
We won't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the big problems because political systems are <unk>
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption comes from energy from energy sources like solar and <unk> and the <unk> of the two percent, and the reason is completely different.
The coal and natural gas are more likely that solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want to take care of energy sources that can compete in time.
Now, if you do that, the entrepreneurs and economists are agree about what policies and African communities <unk> the development of a <unk> energy -- a significant increase in research and energy, and some type of energy control over the Earth.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we will see an energy policy policy of America, or international communities, that reflect on it.
Sometimes the big problems that were used to happen is not enough.
We know from the time that malaria is a result of failure in the food.
But 30 years of research have taught us that AIDS is not the political crisis that affects the distribution of food.
So technology can improve things like the tumor or the systems for the <unk> and the food for food, but there will be water.
Finally, the big problems are sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president of the United States led the war to cancer in the process, but soon we found out that there are many kinds of cancer, some of them were, and only in the last 10 years, and just over the last 10 years they seem to have found any effective treatments and <unk>
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can <unk> but these four elements have been <unk> political leaders, and the population needs to want to solve the problem that institutions have to support the <unk> must actually be a <unk> problem.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of the technology to solve big problems, which is to make a big difference.
But it's a <unk> model.
We're not in <unk>
There is no competition -- like in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> the hard and there and there's no real science fiction science fiction like our solar system -- as we explore the solar system.
In general, I'm going to go to the moon to the moon to the moon to the moon to the moon to the moon to the moon to the moon to the moon to the moon in general, right?
I was just three days.
And really, it wasn't even <unk>
We are alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to use.
God knows that we are not familiar with us.
Many thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start to start with <unk> ideas that have about <unk>
They're so common that they have become <unk> of our society.
I think it's great.
The first is a <unk> there's been a great decline of trust, is a very special belief that is a very interesting.
The second is a <unk> we should have more <unk>
And the third one is a <unk> we should be <unk>
I think that <unk> the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> one and a task -- that I think it gives you a very clear idea about the thing.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I'm going to try to think that there may be a number of activities or institutions that might have been on others.
I don't know.
But I can turn to the surveys of the view, and the classic example of opinion is supposed to be the source of the belief that confidence has been.
When you look at the scientific surveys over time, there's no evidence of it.
That is, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, they keep the same <unk>
And the people who were very sure about 20 years ago, they still have a pretty <unk>
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly the same way.
But this is what it looks like.
What was the key thing that copyright opinion was.
What can you do?
What you're looking at is the cognitive attitudes that people think of when you do certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody else told you <unk>
<unk> in <unk>
<unk> in the teachers of <unk>
You probably need to ask, "What do you do?
And that would be a very simple answer.
And you might say, when you've got your question, "Well, I feel in some, but in other <unk>
What's really interesting.
And ultimately in the real life, we tend to use trust in <unk>
We don't assume that the confidence that we are going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> official or kind of person, is going to be uniform in every single person.
I could, for instance, say that I have to say that I have a kind of French teacher who I know to give the class, but no way to drive the <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good thing.
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to take a look.
<unk> <unk>
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we just leave side with all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> way.
I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the actual level of trust -- because they try to figure out what the good judgment is to actually trust something or not.
Secondly, what happens in the future?
The goal is to have more knowledge.
Frankly, I think it's an actual goal.
This is not the goal I would say.
I would like to get more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it is.
So I'm going to try to make sure that I'm not sure.
And I think that those people who <unk> their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then went around with them, I think, well, I think, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart target in this life.
And I would like to argue whether or not <unk> with intelligence, that's the right answer.
Once you say it, you say, yes, like, yes, that means that what matters in the first place is not the trust, but the <unk>
So what it's about is to make a judgment about how they are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things: we're forced to do a job.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in the Amazon, and it's responsible for it, and it is responsible for a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of <unk>
But if, on the contrary, they're not <unk> we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are tired and honest, but not <unk> in them to bring a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they are <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm really happy to say that I don't have a lot of friends who are tired and responsible for it, but extremely <unk>
If that's not what I do.
But that's what we're going to do today.
The confidence is the answer.
<unk> is what we have to do.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've tried to build <unk> systems for all kinds of institutions, and so we make them easier for us to do it easier to judge their <unk>
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work.
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you know, you know, the problem is that it takes more time to do the best time to do the same.
And we found the same problem in all our public life, and we <unk> that the system of <unk> that is designed to ensure that we can guarantee the <unk> and the evidence of <unk>
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as well.
You know, you know that all of you know that all of you.
<unk> all that, by the goal.
I believe that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if they would be a lot of trust and <unk> to the people that we are safe and whether or not <unk> to determine whether other people are, or politicians are important.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the <unk> actions of the <unk> what it does not do with it.
And third, the <unk>
<unk> to the task to rebuild the trust, puts things into the air.
And I would like to show you what you and I should do.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit.
We can do it if they are two people, and together, trying to improve it.
But the trust, all of us to do is take us off because we give us a lot of money.
You can't reconstruct what other people have been.
You have to give them the foundations to give you to be able to trust you.
You have to be <unk>
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> by the way, all the time, all the time.
But you also have to take care of you that you're worthy of <unk>
How do we do that?
That is a couple of all around the world, what the common people are about.
I'll give you a simple example.
The store where my name is <unk> that I can <unk>
It's going to take me off and go back to the money, or you can change the color of the color of the color that I love you.
That's amazing that it's amazing to them because they were very vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson on that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good part of that is a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So in the end, I think what we're looking at is not something very hard to do.
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
From the early computers of computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital data, the separation between our world and the world of the screen in which the imagination can be <unk>
So this separation has been <unk> more and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one percent of one nation on the glass of a screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I'm <unk> and if there were no <unk>
I started to imagine how it works.
We first created this tool that we put in the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen is his physical body <unk>
The designers can <unk> their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can do with virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool <unk>
But the two hands are still on the screen.
How do we get inside and interact with the digital information using the whole skill of <unk>
In the division of Microsoft, <unk> along with my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and it became a little space on the keyboard in a work.
<unk> a <unk> <unk> with a depth of depth to detect the fingers and the face, now you can lift the hands of the keyboard, get inside of the space, and stick it directly with your hands.
Like the windows and these windows have a location in real space, and it's so easy to take a book from a <unk>
You can see the book, and the <unk> and the words or words with the <unk> sensor that goes down from every single screen to each other.
The architects can show you what the architects can or rotate their models directly with your hands.
In these examples, we are <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make the digital data come to us.
<unk> a lot of us we would have bought and <unk>
Now that doesn't have to worry about it.
What I have here is a virtual reality.
This is the vision that you get from a device on the head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea over again, I thought, instead of just seeing prior to the space, how we can do that are physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would it be a future like this?
At the Media Lab with the MIT Media Lab with me, <unk> <unk> and my <unk> <unk> that we created this single world.
This imam <unk> it was like a 3D scan in 3D space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere within this small space in this small space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And by studying the object, the object, we take it out of the time and space, what it means to say that human movements can <unk> and go back and forth and keep it in the physical world.
You can teach <unk> and the famous distance and the famous piece of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physical reality of a physical reality that you could do.
The students can use it as a tool to understand how the movement of the planets, the physics, the physics, the physical books or the <unk> of text, this is a real experience, and so you can play with it.
But what is more fascinating is that changing the physical part of the computer is imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical world.
You see, the digital information will not just show us something but to start to act directly on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without our physical world.
So we started the talk today by talking about a party, but if you <unk> that -- the only limit that you get is our imagination.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the years of <unk>
When I was first in first grade grade, the government wanted to <unk> to a school for athletes with all of us.
But my mother said, "What do you do?"
My parents wanted me to become in engineering, like them.
After survive the Industrial Revolution believed that there was just a <unk> path to the <unk> a safe job, and so on.
Without the work I'd like to or not.
But my dream was to be an American artist.
This was me, at my time.
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young people to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to school to go to school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the <unk>
But no adult <unk> the idea.
No adult I took on.
I just my friends -- but they were kids, but they were kids, like me.
So at the age of 15 years old, I knew that it was too much greater for me.
My dream is never to be.
<unk> that during the rest of my life -- a second class of second class was the only thing I could see.
And this was so exciting.
So I decided to look at another one.
No one to me around me.
I went to the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that we did.
They were <unk> in China, of course.
"The <unk> is about the <unk>
And it's not true.
The Bible is interesting, but I like the Bible <unk>
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your <unk>
<unk> I said, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
And so it became my tool to go out of this claim to go out of this message, and to <unk> the relationship with my parents.
And I find a new culture also led to my personal habit of reading <unk>
<unk> lots of things.
For example, at the beginning, this map seemed to me out of place because this is what students in China did.
But it had been turned up in a way that China didn't have to be at the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the world.
There are all these research fields like religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> he offers an deeper understanding of a thing.
And I thought if reading was going to work for that -- why not do it in life <unk>
So I started reading books about two.
You can be able to get rid of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with friends with <unk>
For the <unk> the <unk> are economic and <unk>
So for sure, they are all <unk> a fear and the duty of life.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read their books in two languages.
And the way to <unk> Thomas <unk> Thomas <unk> is the way of <unk> Alan <unk> Instead of going to be able to make a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk>
The books they opened up a magic door to meet with people of the past and the present.
I know that I'm not going to feel a single person.
Having a dream is actually not anything compared to what many other people have done.
I have come to believe that this is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that you come from the dreams, where the passion, where your happiness.
So as a child, I can do that for you.
And it's thanks to the books, which I'm here today today -- living back with the purpose of purpose and how much of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thanks for ... Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client of <unk>
I was a graduate student in <unk>
She was a <unk> woman, called <unk>
Alex came back to the first session by using it, and a <unk> <unk> came back in the back of my office and took the shoes and told me that I wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My lunch roommate had a <unk> like a <unk>
And I got a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could do it.
But I didn't do it.
With the stories that Alex <unk> he led me to the <unk> he made me easy just to move the head while he <unk> the solution.
<unk> <unk> are the new <unk> and so what I do was she was right.
You start to work later, you get home later, and you get kids later, until the death goes on.
To <unk> as Alex and I had time to go.
But shortly after that, my <unk> <unk> to press the Alex and I was talking about his <unk> life.
And I did.
I said, "I'm going to get out of the guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> but it's not as if it was to marry <unk>
And then my <unk> said, "No, no, no, but maybe it's <unk>
In addition, the best time to work on the Alex is before you were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk>
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they do, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex being a pause in its developing world.
This made the <unk> of Alex being the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And so I realized that this kind of faith, it was a real problem, and I had real consequences for Alex and his life and his life, but for women's families and the future of the <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means about 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that no one comes to age without going up before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your hand.
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, <unk>
If you work with <unk> love to a <unk> you take your dream for a <unk> I want to see. It's good.
This is not just my hands.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be at 35 years.
This means that eight of the 10 decisions and experiences and experiences that give their life to their life you have gone to when they have 30 and <unk>
People in the <unk> don't get to play.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know that more than half of Americans are alive, they live or they are coming out with their partner for 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and final stage of growth in its <unk> and it is <unk> for the <unk> which means that if there's something they want to do with themselves, now it's the moment for us.
We know that personality changes more times during their <unk> that at any time of life and we know that the female gets to its top on the right-hand side and the things become complicated and things become complicated to <unk>
The <unk> are the time for <unk> on their body and their own.
When we think about the development, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which its daily life and common has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear is often that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in developing countries.
But this is not what the <unk> are about.
The newspapers talk about changes in the space line of the <unk>
The researchers call the <unk>
The journalists told them the <unk> names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've been considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that it defines the <unk>
And the <unk> said that to get big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not right?
What do you think about when you give it to a <unk> in your head and you tell me the other 10 years to start your <unk>
It's not.
He talked to that person and his ambition and his ambition and his ambition and his ambition and his ambition and his ambition to make it happen.
And then every day, the little little little little bit interesting as you or your children come to my office and say something like this: "I know something like this: I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship will not easy.
Or they say, "All right, so as you start a race before the 30, everything will be wrong.
But then it starts to sound like this: "The <unk> are by <unk> and I still have nothing to do.
I had better survive the day I graduated from the <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: And I looked at this during the <unk> of the <unk>
They were all dying and they were <unk> but then at some point around the 30, they had the music and they all began to make it happen.
I didn't want to be the only thing I would go on, so I sometimes think I was married with my husband because he was the nearest chair when he was <unk>
Where are the <unk>
They don't do that.
Well, that sounds like a little bit extreme but not <unk> the risks are very high in the same way.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there is a huge pressure on the <unk> and so so many of us start a career, choose a city, choose a city, and have two or three children in a long period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that you start to show, which is much more difficult and <unk> to make it all of the <unk>
The crisis of <unk> <unk> is not about buying cars in the world.
It's about you realize that you can't have the race you want to do now.
<unk> realize that you can't have the son you want to now, or you can't give a brother to your child, your child, your child.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was they doing? What was it?
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here is a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
By 25, he came to my office because he was, in their own words, having a crisis of course.
He said that I'd like to work on art or humor -- but I still couldn't tell her, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, he lived with a boyfriend that showed more <unk>
And even though we live in a very hard time, his previous life was even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then it turned out to be the same as the saying, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your <unk>
Well, one day she came up with his head on his legs and Franz <unk> for almost every hour.
I just had to buy a new office for <unk> and I had spent all of the morning <unk> with her lots <unk> but then he was watching the empty space that follows after the words <unk> for the words of <unk>
It was about the <unk> when I saw me, and he said, "I'm going to be to be a <unk>
Who is going to take care of me if I <unk>
At that time, I was a lot of jobs, and I didn't say, <unk>
And what I did, I needed it was not a <unk> that was really a <unk>
And I needed a better life better, and I knew this was its opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit in the <unk> while the decade after he died.
So for the next few weeks and months, I said to myself: How do we do something <unk> man or woman, deserve to know.
First of all, I said to her, "You know how to make that crisis of identity and <unk>
So for identity, I mean to do something that -- value to your person.
And something which is an investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> career, and no one knows the future of work, but I know this: I do this.
So now it's the time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to see.
I'm not going to show you <unk> exploration -- I'm <unk> the exploration of it -- that I should not be aware of it.
It's <unk>
I said to her, "You know, I would like to do work and make it <unk>
Secondly, I said to myself: The urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> that you come together with friends with similar minds are coming up in terms of how you know what you know about how you think about how you think about how you think about it, and where it is.
That new piece of capital, that new person who will come out of the end of their own circle more than it is out of it.
The new things come out of what they call the weak friends of friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the blind have a bad job or not work.
But the other half of it, and the weak seas are the form of <unk> to this group.
The half of the work that we created is never <unk> then, knowing the boss of your neighbor is the way to get a job in the <unk>
It's not going to be. It's the science of how information is going on.
For last but not less importantly, it makes you think you don't choose your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> he was soon <unk> to his family. when he has a couple and his own family.
I told him that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better than 30 is better to sit on the head that 20 or even 25 and even 25 and I'm agree with you.
But choose the person who you live right now or <unk> now when everybody on Facebook starts to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before it happens, and it involves being so impressive in love with love as you are at work.
<unk> your family must be an conscious choice of who you and what you want instead of just doing instead of making it work or kill time with you who you are.
So what happened with <unk>
Well, we went back to that <unk> and she found the fellow from a <unk> who was working on an art museum in other places.
This weak link helped to get a job there.
And that job for work was to give you a reason to leave the boyfriend with the <unk>
Now, five years later, it's a special <unk>
This is a man with a man who wants to know.
<unk> his new career, his new family, his new family, and he told me a letter that he said, "The spaces of emergency contacts are not <unk>
The story of desertification, may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with.
It's very easy to do.
The <unk> are like planes that come from the airport in Los Angeles to go to some place in the United States.
Just before the <unk> a <unk> is in its trajectory to the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 35 or even the <unk> a good conversation, a good stage, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even in the past generations of life.
Here's my idea worth spreading.
It's as simple as what I learned to tell you.
It is what I have the privilege of telling the <unk> as it turns out, all the time, the <unk> are not the new <unk> and the <unk> of your identity, you get your naked hands, you put your naked eyes.
You don't stop to define what they didn't know or what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're doing their life today.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very detailed work in <unk> <unk> for a work that was even more <unk>
I was going to teach you to teach students from seventh schools in New York.
And as any teacher, I took care of it.
I gave them off.
When the work came, <unk> <unk>
And what I called me the attention was that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst friends.
Some of those who had a better performance didn't have <unk>
And some of my most intelligent children were not going so well.
And that made me think.
The kind of things you need to learn in math in seventh grade, because they're <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not allowed and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for the time.
After several years of <unk> I got to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of the students and learning from a <unk> perspective from a physical perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure better than the best way we know how to measure better than we are.
It's the <unk> but what if we have success in school and in life depends on a lot more than the ability to learn how fast and how much it is it?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of scenarios and in every study of my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the Academy <unk> West <unk>
And we tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who was <unk>
We went to the National Institute of <unk> and we tried to predict what kids would be able to do.
We studied professors in <unk> working in real neighborhoods really hard to figure out what teachers still are teaching for the end of the year school and of <unk> who will be the most effective role in their <unk>
We associate with companies that are able to figure out what these marketers are going to maintain their own lives.
And who is going to win more money?
In all of those contexts very different, it came out as an important feature of success.
And it wasn't the social activity.
It wasn't the good thing, and the physical health, and it was not <unk>
It was the case.
<unk> is passion and <unk> to reach very long times.
The determination is to have it.
<unk> is to hold up its future, day after day, not just for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
The determination is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a race to all of us.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools.
I asked thousands of students from high school students who were doing my determination to determination and then waited around a year to see who they were.
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly higher chance of <unk> even when they <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the clinical trials that felt the kids when they were at school.
So it's not only in West Virginia. And in the <unk> National Institute of <unk> in which it matters to us, in the school, especially for children in <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is the little thing that we know how little the science about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you learn how to determination to determination in <unk>
What do I have to do to teach kids a little bit of it?
How do you keep hearing the long <unk>
The more honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you an example.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many individuals who are simply not getting forward with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination are often not related to or is even going to take it up to the <unk>
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about to develop the determination on children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not about it, but it can change the world.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow and grow in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they're <unk> because they don't believe that corruption is an equal condition for itself.
So the productivity of growth is a great idea for developing countries.
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where I are.
That's the work that we have for us.
We need to take our best ideas, our deepest beliefs and we need <unk>
We need to measure whether they've been successful and we have to be willing to be willing to fix them and start to start all over the world.
In other words, we need to be certain that our children are more <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan, like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> <unk> is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of the other.
Since that time, I was <unk> by this incredible idea.
But for a while, it seems to be as <unk> as the Grand Canyon of China.
In the last few years, I've been asking myself if I can bring up this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language that can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and how a new method would be possible.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each one of the dancers of each other.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster way.
A Chinese Chinese <unk> 20 billion dollars.
You only need a thousand to understand that.
The first 200 people will will be able to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read signals out of traffic, to understand the basic idea of the pages of pages or the <unk>
Today I start with eight to show you how it works.
They're <unk>
And so your mouth as it might be possible to be possible until it is possible.
They get a mouth.
This is a person who is going to take a look.
<unk> <unk>
If the shape of the fire is a person on both sides, as if I was shouting at <unk> <unk> I am <unk> I am <unk> this symbol is actually <unk> in the way that it's called, but I like to believe that it's the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree tree tree tree tree, tree tree, tree tree tree tree, tree tree, tree tree tree tree, tree tree, tree tree, tree tree, tree tree, tree tree, tree tree, tree tree, tree tree, tree tree, tree tree, tree tree, tree tree, tree tree, tree tree, tree tree, tree tree tree, tree tree, tree tree, tree tree, tree tree, tree tree, tree tree, tree tree, tree tree, tree tree, tree
This is a <unk>
the sun.

And the symbol of the door looks like a couple of doors of a <unk>
So I call this <unk> to these two.
They're building blocks so that they think many more things.
a person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two is -- two are company, three of them.
If one person in their arms, this person is saying <unk> and so on.
The person inside the <unk>
It is a laser, like <unk> inside of it.
A tree is a tree <unk>
Three trees together. We also have the forest.
You take a video underneath the tree, we have the <unk>
You take a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk> --  -- <unk> -- as a tree -- as a tree, it's pretty obvious.
Remember the <unk>
Two-thirds of together, it makes it very dangerous to it very fast.
Three thirds together, that's a lot of it.
You see fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of innovation.
Two <unk> together.
Three together, those are <unk>
You take the sun and the <unk> and the <unk>
It also means morning, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the surface.
A door. You take a table inside the door, it's the <unk>
You take a mouth inside the door, do something.
<unk> <unk> there is somebody in it.
This person is coming out of a door.
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, are <unk>
Three women together, they have care is <unk>
So we've already gone for almost 30 years.
When you use this <unk> the first eight <unk> will allow you to do this.
The next group of eight characters is building another one.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundred <unk> which is the same thing that you learn from eight years.
So after knowing the <unk> we started to make mistakes.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk> because Japan is in China.
So a sun next to us.
One person behind Japan, what do we do?
a person.
The character on the left is two <unk>
In the ancient China, that's meant to be <unk> because the Chinese <unk> to their enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the theme today has become the same.
A mouth that tells you where it comes out of the <unk>
This is a slide to remind you that I have to stop talking and go out of it. Thank you.
What I prefer to be passionate about is the films I see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, and we saw the <unk>
So the whole movie is the case.
His favorite character was <unk> by course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a lot of money.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's <unk>
We now live and bring our children into a kind of a complex <unk>
But the <unk> <unk> was an event on it.
It didn't look like this.
The trend actually took 70 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal kid and a kid <unk> to a guy named <unk> <unk>
You know what I'm thinking.
There is a great difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the <unk> and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very long violence in the world.
The monkeys are pretty <unk>
But I think that if the Internet was done today, the <unk> would say, <unk> you are the ode of nations like this.
<unk> shoes to <unk> to <unk> to <unk> a computer <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another one of the other <unk> <unk> is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did to see <unk> <unk> a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that point, I also had a son who had a son at all.
of just three years.
It wasn't invited to the left because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the disease was <unk>  So he looked at it in the room and he was struck as a mom with his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what he was going on, but I don't think he understood it.
I wonder what it is.
So what about <unk>
And I would like to share with you a sense that if you were an army <unk>
<unk> this with <unk>
How does it lead to us?
And we used good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow up, and not a world of men who <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much energy in the movies in the movies for our children, and so little of the <unk> <unk>
There is a lot of literature on the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk>
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this problem.
I know from experience that <unk> doesn't give me the right framework that I would have used to navigate the world of the adults who are <unk>  I think at the moment I actually expected them to come up because it's the end of the film, right?
My search has been done.
Why are they going to stay there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on the <unk> and get their perspective, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost as if for being a kid, you have to be an <unk> animal and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are lots of exceptions, and I defend the <unk> of Disney at any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, although the boys, the kids, are not really their public goal.
They do a great job to teach girls how to fight the <unk> but not necessarily show the kids how to protect the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have a lot of great women who write new stories for our children, as well as the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> but they don't leave it from being a war.
Of course, the most successful thing about all of the time continues by showing in classic <unk> every one of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and a man and a man and two men who are doing a little bit more.
So as many of you who are thinking, this year, finally came back home.
So I <unk> all of you.
Do you remember the critical time when it came <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has made a film of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let them go.
Well, almost none of these movies about the <unk>
I don't know if you've heard this.
It's not going to be roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book for the 1980s, and in the 1980s, he recorded a conversation that had had a conversation with a friend of films that they did.
And it's very simple. There are just three questions that have to be <unk> in the film, there is more of a female character that has gone on.
So you have to get the <unk>
These women talk to each other.
Their conversations are about something more apart from the guy that you do.  Thank you. Thank you.  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Two women who exist and they talk about things like that.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet very rarely I see it in the film that we know and <unk>
In fact, this week I went to see a very nice movie of very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- a sense of consensus about what is a Hollywood movie movie -- it's a Hollywood film movie now.
<unk> isn't the proof of <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the movie happens in a embassy where men and women are <unk> for the crisis of the world.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep conversations and painful on this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the great qualities to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is true.
So we did.
In 2011, of the 100 more popular movies, how many of them believe they have <unk>
<unk> isn't wrong.
It's not the same as the number of women that we've chosen recently to Congress, so it's fine.
But there is a greater number that that's going to happen.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done before.
This is what he said, "This is what he <unk>
In the United States, one in the United States, one of five women says that has been <unk> sexually transmitted diseases.
I don't think it is the case.
I think the films for children have something to do with that.
Nor do I believe that video videos or <unk> are closely related to them, but something like me, and when I hear that data, one of the things that I think is that there is a great amount of <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What does it do about it?
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is to beat the <unk> with violence and then put it on the stage, which is a woman who has no friends and no <unk>
We are <unk>
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this statistic statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools like <unk> <unk> and we hope that this <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our kids to keep their children so far.
I mean, I think the list of Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean the parents.
I think we have to show our children male kids a new definition of <unk>
The definition of curiosity is changing as well.
Do you read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter to know what his favorite character of "The <unk> <unk> You know what <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What do they have in common today?
Maybe it's not just the <unk>
I think it's true.
I think these are the two people in those movies that know more than anyone, and I love to share their knowledge with other people to be able to achieve their potential.
They are good.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my child.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I tell my <unk> <unk> and fight only and more stories and more stories and more stories and more stories than their work is to join a team for women, to help other people to improve and be better people, like the <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
As a child, I lived in college, and one of the things that I wanted was to look at the sea on the coast of Los Angeles, because my parents told me that it would give me something.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're hard to look at sand and it's hard to see.
However, by the time, I was <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me to <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love for the past and the <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I realized that I was not enough.
Because, as soon as in Egypt, my little beach in 1968, I had grown up at one of the <unk> miles from the <unk>
And my slime mold had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see in using it.
This is a remarkable place in the Southern Ocean.
And place, in simple view, it seems to be <unk> but when we use the engine and the process of using color -- suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're seeing are the real chemical changes in the landscape of the cause of building materials and activities of the ancient world.
I want to share with you how we have used the satellite data to find a old city of ancient city, called <unk> for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old capital capital for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle East, about 4,000 years ago.
The place you put in the <unk> of Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle East, there was this great renaissance of old art -- architecture and religion, and the religion, and the language.
The <unk> always have known that <unk> was located somewhere near the <unk> of the two kings that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge <unk>
This area is large, it's huge measures about <unk>
When you go back to the <unk> <unk> right next to the <unk> and as it changed the time, they went to this and looked at the entire city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk>
And I think, at random -- it would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the <unk> eyes and using it by using it.
So we use data from NASA to make a map of the place, with very remote control.
We were able to see where the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, and it's even more interesting, and it's even more interesting, that you see inside the circle here, that we think might be the location of <unk>
So we associate with the Egyptians doing <unk> <unk> you can see here.
When I say <unk> is like <unk> you show up in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look at layers of human nature.
five feet down, under a <unk> layer of <unk> we found a dense layer of <unk>
So this means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a layer of <unk> from several hundred years to go from the Middle East, exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> what shows that there was a <unk> <unk> <unk>
This might seem that it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones in the Middle East, these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of <unk> which is the Middle East in this place.
We also have evidence of a workshop of the elite extremism that shows that what we've been there, was a very important.
We still don't find <unk> here, but we <unk> the place in a close future to <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of the satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the continent of the Middle East, probably written in <unk> about 4,000 years.
And the knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that.
So it turns out that TED was not founded in 1984 in 1984 -- <unk>
And so the ideas that ideas really began in 1984 in a lost city is not for a lot of time and found from it.
It certainly puts the <unk>
Many thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I want to thank you for your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door <unk>
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that is <unk>
Now you get a group of <unk>
They are <unk> in a <unk> career, and they are on direction to their <unk>
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk>
And then in front of the front door <unk>
There are lines flying around everywhere, except that they spend on their hand, X-ray of the wheels that they end up in places like <unk> <unk> the threshold of the door.
And what you see in the hall or what you're on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light.
<unk> with the hand of <unk>
From his chair, about a horse <unk>
It's a horse that <unk>
You can feel your <unk> blue <unk> on your nose.
You can smell <unk> <unk> and you are going to go into the mouth.
And I went back to one side and I come into her room.
We already in the room, and doing use of his imagination, imagine <unk>
It's a little bit <unk> clothes, singing on their <unk> of center, singing <unk> One <unk>
<unk> <unk>
The ground has been captured with a <unk> path and from the oven, and from the oven, come to you <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The <unk> <unk> of the hands, <unk> to you.
All right.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest which leads to every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> of the United States.
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, and I guess, that this was like the end of a <unk> of <unk>
There were several men and a few of these very few different ages of different ages and different habits of life.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers.
<unk> the names of tens and tens of years.
<unk> poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who I could memorize over the entire order of a <unk>
And I thought, "This is <unk>
These people must be aware of nature.
And I started to talk to some of the problems.
And this is a man named Ed Eliot who had come from England and he has one of the best <unk>
I asked him when he realized that you were a <unk>
Ed <unk> "I am not a <unk>
In fact, I have a memory there.
Everybody who cares about this competition is that they have a normal memory they have.
We have been trained to do these solid acts of memory using some old old old <unk> years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used to be used to memorize their mortgage.
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I know that I had no heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the classroom, and <unk> who is a wonderful English and brilliant man, even though a little bit <unk> told me, <unk> you are an American journalist and a <unk>
You know why.
And I said, "You're <unk>
And I would like to talk to you about <unk> <unk> how to memorize the order on a golf ball.
That will tell the world that anybody can do it.
And I said, "Well, I'm not <unk> but maybe I'm <unk> but maybe I'm <unk>
I mean, you have to start with something else.
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey, for me.
I ended up spending most of the next year not just training my memory but also <unk> trying to figure out how sometimes it works why sometimes it doesn't work and what it can be done and what it can be done.
I met a lot of people really interesting.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very well with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a <unk> problem.
Somebody incredibly <unk> but it was a window that allowed to see what our memory is.
On the other end of the spectrum of the spectrum of the spectrum of the spectrum of the spectrum of the spectrum of the spectrum of the spectrum of the spectrum of the spectrum of the spectrum of the spectrum of the spectrum of the spectrum of the spectrum of the spectrum of the spectrum of the spectrum of the spectrum of the spectrum of the spectrum of the spectrum
This is <unk>
We went on a afternoon together in the public library in New York City.
And to come back, I would give you a sense of thinking about memory makes something over 2,000 years ago in the <unk> and then in the Middle East.
And I learned a lot of really interesting.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time in which this idea of having broken memory and <unk> it wasn't a very rare thing as it can happen today.
So a lot of time, people spend in their memory to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
It has changed us, and I would say that they have changed us.
As we have no need to remember, sometimes it seems that we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places in our planet where we still find people who are passionate about this idea of a healthy memory and <unk> and <unk> is this competition that is so unique of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> is the same thing.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at the University of London invited a group of <unk> <unk> to the lab.
They wanted to know that it has a brains in some ways, changing or <unk> different from the rest of us.
The answer was, no.
They're more intelligent than the <unk>
They gave them a <unk> <unk> and the answer was really not.
There was yet a really significant difference between the brains of the brains of memory management and the subjects of control that the <unk>
When they put them in a MRI machine, you can see their brains as <unk> numbers, faces and shapes of it -- they found that in the memory failures they found out in the memory management of the brain, different parts of the brain, so on.
In effect, they seem to be <unk> a part of the brain that involves space and <unk>
Why? There's something we can learn from this.
On the side of the <unk> <unk> it is kind of like an armed career, where each year comes somebody with a new way to remember more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a day.
In his desk, in front of him, there's 36 <unk> <unk> <unk> which he's about to try to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and he just invented and that he was just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk>
In an hour.
And while there is a large number of ways to remember things in these rooms -- absolutely all the techniques they used at the end is not just the only concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It's illustrates with a well-known paradox known as <unk> <unk> <unk> -- I say to two people who remember the same thing.
That's their <unk>
And then I'm going to ask you to look at <unk>
And when I went back later, and I asked them that word I told you about a <unk>
<unk>
The person who told me that his name is <unk> it's unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said that his work is <unk>
The same word, different capacity to <unk> that's right.
What happened?
Well, the name itself doesn't mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
And with all the other memories that you know for your mind.
But the word, <unk>
They were <unk>
They have blood pressure.
<unk> good when you get home to work.
Probably not.
And when I put that word for the first time, we started to put <unk> <unk> for <unk> at some time.
One of the most interesting techniques to do this is about two years ago in <unk> <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of the <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet named <unk> who was <unk> to a <unk>
He had hired it as it turns out, because before, if he wanted to give a very good party -- you can't bring a <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up on foot, his memory poem and he was <unk> and as soon as he was, the hall was <unk>
And so on.
But not only killed everyone, but it turns out.
Nobody could say who was there, no one could remember where they were going.
So they could not be <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> the only thing in the middle of the rubble, didn't hold your eyes and realized that with your eyes in your mind, I could see where I had been sitting every day.
I took the family from <unk> where they were their loved ones between the <unk>
What you would do is to go back to that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we're not good at remembering names or phone numbers, or instructions for our colleagues, we have visual memory and outer space.
If you were <unk> the first 10 words in the history that I just told you from <unk> is very likely that you will be very difficult to do it.
But I will tell you that if you ask them to tell me who I was sitting on the horse would be sitting on his belly -- it would be able to get <unk>
The idea of the memory of memory is to create this building with the eyes of its mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want for, the more <unk> the more <unk> the <unk>
This is an advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, at the first time in <unk> in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to do it in the same way that I would have done it -- if you would have done it -- if you had a <unk>
What you could do is imagine that you're on the door of your home.
And this is a kind of an absolutely crazy picture and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing they want to mention is that competition completely <unk>
And then you can imagine moving into your house, and you see the <unk> of the <unk>
And that tells you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see <unk> <unk> to remind that anecdote that you want to know.
And then you put it in the kitchen, and the fourth subject that you would see would be that strange journey, that they did for a whole year and have some friends for them to help them.
So it's like the speakers -- <unk> <unk> -- no word -- no word for word, that is going to confuse you, but typical <unk>
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek Greek <unk>
It's a tradeoff in when people thought about the <unk> and on the edge, with this sort of terms of <unk>
The phrase <unk> <unk> it would be like the first place in his memory.
I saw this was just compelling and I got out of it.
I went to some of these memory skills and I had the idea of writing something year about this <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is an extraordinary event.
seriously, it's just like seeing a lot of people sitting in <unk> -- I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets <unk> the <unk>
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things going on in the minds of these people, but I don't have it.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to get rid of him in his place.
So I began to spend 15 or 20 minutes every day, before I was sitting in the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe one of the names of an old school <unk> school bought in a <unk> market.
And I found that this was <unk>
But it would have been expected to do it.
It was fun because it wasn't just to train my memory.
What is actually going to do is to improve more and more the ability to create and imagine these images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and I wish that in the eye of the mind.
I was pretty sure.
This is me, using my medical team for the training of training for the <unk>
It is a couple of <unk> and some of them covered with tape <unk> just two <unk> because the red line is the worst enemy of a piece of memory.
I ended up coming back to the same competition that I had covered a year before, I had the idea that I could be able to get it into a kind of <unk>
I thought this could be a good thing.
The problem was that the answer came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to do.
Of course it's nice to be nice to be able to memorize <unk> and numbers of them, but actually this is not the point.
These are just <unk>
Because in the early principles of how the brain works.
And it doesn't need to be able to build a memory of memory or memorize <unk> and to benefit from a little bit about how his mind.
So we often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift of a <unk> but not the case.
<unk> <unk>
At the same level we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we really focused on it.
And he said, <unk> these memory techniques are just <unk>
In fact, it's not even true.
And they do it because they do it.
And we put a kind of deep view, a kind of complete attention that most of you don't know.
But the reality is that there's no problem.
So it's like things are <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today, it's what I call the <unk> that I couldn't even remember I had a memory problem, which is the notion that life is the sum of our own.
How are we willing to lose what is our little <unk> <unk> in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks up to us, <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there is such incredible memory <unk>
But if you want to live in a <unk> life, you must be the kind of person who reminds you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk today about the last 30 years of history.
It's a lot to cover up in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so you can just take a <unk>
Because 30 years ago, I am a computer, and I had six years and lived there in my home of my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my mother.
In the corner, from my cell, I was the bathroom to share with my sister.
And between my deceased and the bathroom, there was a cousin who gave the emergency room to the <unk>
And there were all of us who were looking at it, and every time I was going from my room to the bathroom, every single day, every time I got married, and I was going to come back and come back in a row.
And I was that.
It was <unk>
<unk> that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that home.
That's the architecture of architecture.
<unk>
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, and of course -- but of those connections that we feel in the places that we feel in the places that we have.
And it's not surprising that we feel that way, because according to the National Security Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time beneath the ground.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture, we're surrounded by architecture, we're surrounded by nature.
That's a lot.
The architecture tells us in ways that we don't even get to.
That makes us a little bit <unk> and very, very expensive.
And this means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you're going to do in <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that you think about it in a building two years ago by the <unk>
This is a question.
It's a <unk> that you use to create an emotional connection with the ways that we build our <unk>
It's an emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long time.
We used it about 200 years ago to build <unk>
We use it in the 19th century, to build the art of art.
And in the 20th century, in America, we used to build <unk>
You know, these <unk> are <unk> in front of the sea, away from the <unk>
This is very, very helpful because building things is <unk>
It's <unk> it takes a lot of time.
The people who <unk> the <unk> and governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we found buildings like this.
It's a nice, <unk>
It's the Library of <unk> which was ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, has a <unk> there's this little red dot near the red, which you leave with this <unk> the <unk> the children, the values of property, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, it was another library, which looks like this.
It's in it.
This library shows how we use media in the digital world.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to go.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both <unk> <unk> are so completely <unk>
And the answer is that architecture works at the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that constantly generate new technologies, new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for human life.
We were able to pull together and we would get so far from the people.
Everyone from black, this is a <unk> you believe that we feel very well, but we're dead in the right because we don't have another choice.
We need to go on the other side and go back to connect with those <unk> symbols and <unk>
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we started talking about <unk> we do it in the back of the back and over and over and over again. So we've done it over the last 300 years.
Well, 30 years ago, <unk> of the <unk>
The architects were busy doing with the <unk>
It has to do with it.
That can be done.
<unk> small <unk>
something really happened.
So we went back to the 1980s, and we started to incorporate those together.
I would like to share a couple of things.
We take those shapes we know that we know and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added <unk> and we used new materials.
Let me show you something.
We don't take <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we turned them into neuroscience that can be <unk> made out of glass.
The shapes are <unk>
The <unk> became <unk>
The <unk> grew up to the size of the <unk>
<unk>
But they were the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent the whole time in food centers we moved into the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own lives.
And these antibodies could be to <unk> to <unk> or <unk>
You know, with a <unk> <unk>
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with them.
They're <unk> because instead of creating new spaces, we make memories of other places.
I know very well, and all of you know that this is not the <unk>
This is true.
And the architects feel frustrated and we started to make sure that it was a new way in the other direction.
In the '80s and early on, we started working with the <unk> <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now we've now talked about with new design techniques for computer, and we find new <unk> some ways that are <unk> against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's <unk>
Along the way, I would like to share with you.
But then, what happened then, was something <unk>
In 1997, we took this building.
It's the <unk> of <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed the relationship of the world with architecture with architecture with architecture as the relationship of the world.
Paul <unk> said that he was one of those rare moments when he <unk> academics and public in general, were completely agree on a building.
The New York Times <unk> this building of <unk>
And it turns out to be a <unk> in a 2,500 percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> I wanted to show you one of those <unk>
The whole world wanted one, and it was all around me.
He was our first artist.
But how is it possible that these molecules and <unk> and <unk> how it might be possible to become ubiquitous across the world?
And it happened, because the media are going around them and quickly we quickly learned that those different forms of culture are <unk>
We've created an emotional reaction with these ways.
The same thing did the same thing for the world.
So they all believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and <unk>
And this phenomenon in the early 1930s, happened with other architects and <unk>
I went to <unk> and I went to <unk> and what happened with these few architects of the new threshold of the new millennium, actually started with the entire architecture, the digital media began to increase the speed of information.
And you know, for example, how do they use architecture for this?
A thousand years ago, you would have to have taken him to the next village to see a building.
The transport is <unk> you can take a plane, a plane, you can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the <unk> and in the end, all of us are photographers in architecture, and the building gets further beyond its visual location beyond its size.
The architecture is everywhere -- that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture, it finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because the architecture moves so fast, so it's moving as fast as it moves as fast as it moves as fast as it moves as fast as it moves so fast, so it's moving as fast as it moves so fast, so it moves so fast, it's moving so fast, it's moving so fast, it's moving so fast, it's moving so fast, it's moving so fast, it's moving so fast,
It wasn't quite accurate to think about a building.
It takes a long time to build a building, three or four years ago, and at that time, an architect can design two, two, or 100 new buildings before to know if that I designed four years was a success or not.
Because there have never been a good feedback in nature.
So this is how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a movement of two years ago.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we didn't have any idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to come back to me -- because we are on the threshold of the greatest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel or the <unk> and it's the revolution in the media.
So my theory is that when you think about the media, the media begins to look faster, even faster, to get to be in both <unk> and it will be <unk> effectively the difference between innovation and <unk> among us, and the public.
We can now make more symbols almost <unk>
Let me show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up.
We were <unk> to replace this building in <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> <unk> in the state of New York City.
It's a <unk> community.
But that meant that two years before the building, it was already the building, it was part of the community, and as the drawings was exactly the exact same thing.
The building came to be part of the community, that first summer, when people started to get to come and share it in social media, the building stopped just a building, became a building, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that you did in the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, it becomes part of the personal narrative -- and that makes it <unk> with the collective memory of the collective memory, and by the way.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think of architecture as thinking about architecture, as we think of architecture as thinking about nature.
We can tell us what we think of architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but that have changed the relationship between us and the <unk>
Think for a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building were built today, first <unk> on the Internet in search of <unk>
And I said, "Well, I think, for examples of innovation, about how it can be a <unk>
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell you that there's no only answer to what it can be a library today.
It's part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to life.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words and drawings and an extraordinary audience, and one is not a <unk> audience, which doesn't make something that I haven't seen before.
The architects can listen to them, and you don't leave it <unk> by nature.
That means that the surgeon of a style to another, from one of the other parts of a movement to another.
In fact, we can go forward and find solutions to the problems that face society.
This is the end of the story of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different to the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be <unk> and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
And this means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in ideas of what it must be like.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for the shapes that are going to happen.
That means that the buildings are <unk> to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a garage in Miami in Miami is also able to serve to do sport or <unk> or even you can get it out there at night.
This means that three architects can sleep with swimming in the East <unk> in New York, and raising half a million dollars from the hidden community around that cause, it's not a client alone.
It means that any building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion and <unk> as <unk> and <unk> as the animals that are going to be.
Because no matter if it's a cow or a robot who builds our <unk>
It doesn't matter how we build what we do.
The architects already know how to make more <unk> more <unk> and more <unk>
We've been waiting for all of you.
And finally, we are not in remote areas.
Think about an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, better cities, because there are a lot of things in game science.
The buildings not just reflect our society, but they give them way to the more <unk> the local libraries where they are connected to our children, and the step of the day.
Many thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
This is my <unk>
It just turned out to be a year and already started walking.
And it does this very large way of the children of a year, <unk> as if their body was moving too fast for their children.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you want to do for the moment is you can do it for the time.
She really loves his son.
You know, you know, <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
You know, all your friends do this and my mom and my mom realize that I used to do it. And he made me think about it.
How is it that we suddenly are not comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't even understand.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at <unk>
This is <unk> has 13 years and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, it only wants to be mistaken and <unk>
<unk> at night.
It is preparing for the next week at school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom tells it all the little days that it's beautiful, every day in school, somebody tells it that it's happening.
Among what his mom says to him and what his friends, or years of school said to me, "I don't know who it is.
So a video of her itself, it will be on YouTube, and he asked others to leave a <unk> "I am <unk> or I'm <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has received over 50,000 dollars.
Some of these are so <unk> that they don't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal human and neural activity that gets these answers at one of the stages of their most vulnerable lives.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, in their most teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is <unk>
Well, teenage girls are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Never before we have been so connected, in a way -- so <unk> as <unk> as <unk>
As a mother said, "It's like a party in his room all the <unk>
There is just no problem.
And social pressures that go out of the hand with that are <unk>
This environment, it's always going to be <unk> to our children to <unk> in the number of people who have and the types of comments that are going on.
There is no division between life and the real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what it is or what it is.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what's authentic and what it's wrong.
What is the most exciting thing in the life of somebody in front of what is normal in a context like this?
And where are they looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> of the news of the girls in now.
<unk> <unk>
The technique of the <unk> is now a <unk>
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For those of you who are <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture.
It's not hard to see what the blind people look like.
But the kids aren't immune to this.
And as the stars of the sports of sports, and the singers would <unk>
But what is the problem with this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and be good <unk>
But in a <unk> culture, we are teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort at the price of all the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities and other aspects of the other aspects start to be.
six, six of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't look like this.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings, and as we inform society and the developing world.
<unk> percent, almost one of three teenage teenagers are not interested in the discussions of professional schools.
One of five are not going to happen to classes for the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season, if you don't think you do it, you see good enough -- well, if you don't believe that you're good enough -- you know, a bit lower than the average note at the average of your fellow people who don't care about it.
And this phenomenon has been transformed in India.
And it turns out regardless of what they really are.
So, to give you good of course, we're talking about how you see how you are really talking about how you are really talking about how you are really talking about how you are really talking about it.
The low self-esteem on its body is <unk>
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers who are <unk> are doing the less physical and physical activity, they eat less and less engaged in more productive labor that can lead to a computer.
They have low quality.
They are more <unk> by people around the globe, and they're in greater risk of learning.
And we think that's why this is all about what you take more <unk> like the use of alcohol and drugs, and of drug drugs, <unk> surgery -- to ages early and without protection and <unk>
The search for the perfect body is pushing the healthcare system and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they have <unk> again, regardless of whether or not they have higher rates of <unk>
On 17 percent of women don't show an interview in one day where they don't feel safe with the way you see.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would it be that <unk>
<unk> this potential is of interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, talking about itself, it doesn't take you very far.
It doesn't work.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three different ways that we have to establish trust in their own body.
We need to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their bodies.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very impressed when I learned that a lot of these <unk> programs without realizing the situation.
So we have to make sure that the program we follow our children will not only have a positive impact but also an impact on it.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six different areas, the first is the influence of family and friends.
These six aspects are really important for anybody willing to provide a education in your body that work.
An education is a fundamental education, but we deal with this problem requires every one of us to step back in the matter and be a better model for women and girls in our own lives.
So what the status of the status of the status of the women are seen and found out in our families.
It's not good to tell the contribution of our politicians in order to use hair or the size of their <unk> or the <unk> that determination or the success of a foreign athlete depends on the fact that it's not a big deal.
We need to start to judge people so that they are, not as you can see.
All of us, we can start by doing this with the responsibility for the kind of images and comments we published in our social networks.
We can <unk> people based on their effort and their actions and not in their minds.
And let me tell you, when it was the last time you were <unk>
In summary, we have to work together as governments and governments like companies, to really change our culture, so that our children will grow up with the whole person to be able to do it, but the <unk>
We need to put people who are actually <unk> the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's do that to be the ones that come out of the big screen, because we just have a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way that they think you can never see the <unk> of being who they are, or what they want in their lives.
Think about what this might mean for someone in their lives.
who they have in common?



And his <unk>
It could just be the woman who is going to go two, and what would it mean for her if I was convicted of that <unk> voice in your interior, that I would give you a long, long strand -- <unk> -- more <unk> -- more <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were <unk> this and he would give it to his potential of that <unk>
Right now, the obsession with our culture with images is <unk>
But we <unk> our own children.
<unk> that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love that we love them for those who are and why they do it.
<unk> to the self-esteem of our schools.
And each of us, the way we talk and we look at other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year age today will become a safe year after the same time.
So let's do that.
On November November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> went to a hotel in Manhattan and killed the <unk> <unk> the <unk> leader of the <unk>
In <unk> they were able to do it, but I would be married by other local charges in the company of others, they started planning attacks at about 12 centuries ago, including <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Luckily, those plans would be <unk> by an FBI <unk>
And so the pump of 1993 in the World Trade Center, couldn't afford to help.
He later <unk> he would be convicted by his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in England. In 1983, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with an American man, and the two of the two did the two of the most possible of us to give me a happy.
Just when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even the most few, even most of the Christians are coming to college.
And I saw that when people take time to address it, it doesn't require much to be a lot to want the same things in life.
However, in all religion, all around the world, there is always a small fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their contribution that you think you have to use all the possible means, so that they all lived like them.
A few months before the arrest he sat in, he sat with me and explained that in the last week, he and some friends, had been going to training on Long Island, and to make sure that we were going to throw it out.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without know, our group, was <unk> by the way.
When I got <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder, and explained to me how to point at about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that he <unk> I gave you a little orange light on the target and, for all of all, especially mine, all the goal was on the Internet.
My uncle became the other and in Arab <unk>
As a child.
All of all, the comment produced a lot of success, but just a few years later, I understood what it was like to them as well.
They found out in me, the same level of destruction that my father could be.
These people later would be able to be able to put it on a 700 pounds of explosives in the parking lot in the north of the World Trade Center, which causing an explosion that killed six people and killed other people.
I admired those men.
He called <unk> which means <unk>
When I turned around, I had moved 20 times. That's my childhood, my childhood wasn't allowed to make a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about somebody who was given to me, and going to another city.
As it was always I was a new face of the class as often as <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the plane but to be the new class of class, leading and <unk> it was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent my life reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't developed social skills, to say that I was growing up under <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
And I said, <unk> judge people, based on people, rather like their race or their <unk>
So how could I open the <unk>
One of the first experiences that they put on my way to think, was to think, was for the Islamic elections in Iraq.
In a <unk> program where I was sitting at the National Institute in <unk>
My group was <unk> in the subject of <unk> violence -- as I had been worried about -- almost all my life, was something that I was feeling very much wrong.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, to the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids who had done was meant to catch it for me.
I took several days out of the light that I realized and I realized that there was no <unk> between two.
I had never had a friend of mine and frankly I felt very proud of having to do the barrier that all life was made out of that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job in Bush <unk> a <unk> park in <unk>
I found out with people from all sorts of kinds of beliefs and cultures, that experience turned into the development of my character.
All the life was taught me that the <unk> was a sin and by definition, all the gay were bad <unk>
So I had the opportunity to work with people working with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most powerful and less true that I had seen in life.
Having a kid, I developed a sense of empathy towards the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to try to figure out people in the way that I would have wanted to be able to do.
For that feeling I could see the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how to be <unk> but I know what it's going to be like for something beyond my control.
Then he came back.
Every night, Jon Stewart was doing it to be honest about my <unk> and I helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual sexual orientation, don't have anything to do with the character.
In a lot of ways he came up with me in a moment in which I was desperately <unk>
Instead, the inspiration can come out of it, and that a Nigerian magician, would have had a better influence in my life that my own father, <unk> was not in <unk>
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something that I preserve at my heart for a long time.
She looked at me with someone who had been tired of somebody who had suffered enough with tadpoles, and she said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy you needed to keep all of that hate in your house.
My real name is not <unk>
And it changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So what I decided to go out and walk into a possible way.
Well, it's true.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, one day, who will give you violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, that even though I was <unk> this violent ideology on this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't have <unk>
On the other hand, I decided to use my experience to fight for terrorism and violence.
I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, by the terrible pain and the loss that terrorism has been produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to speak, against those acts without sense, as a result, the actions of my father.
So with this point, I put up here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, that the kids don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
At this moment there is a film that was happening in their minds.
It's a movie.
There is 3D <unk> and it has <unk> <unk> of what you hear and you see right now. But that's just the beginning.
You have to get rid of it.
It makes your body, your heart.
It's got emotions, right?
It has memories, like the moments of your childhood, which is called <unk>
And it has a voice based on your mental illness.
The heart of the movie is you who are <unk>
This film is your consciousness, the subject of consciousness, the subject of the mind and the world.
Now, consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of being human.
Each one of us is happy.
We all have a personal film.
There is nothing to do.
At least, I know that I have an experience.
I don't know what you are doing.
The consciousness also is also the reason for that.
If we were not aware of our lives, it would have sense or value.
But at the same time it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these <unk>
Why are we just not just robots that <unk> what we have to do to produce outcomes without experience the <unk>
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I show you that to integrate the consciousness to the science, you need some ideas to understand it.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
The science, by nature, is <unk>
The consciousness, of nature.
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost everything in the 20th century, it was <unk>
So what psychology was studying behavior -- the neuroscience -- the neuroscience of studying the brain -- but never nobody mentioned the consciousness.
It even 30 years ago, when TED came out, there were very few scientists on consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, all started to change.
<unk> as Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science <unk>
And since then, there was a real attachment for the scientific work of consciousness.
And this work was amazing.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of work in the great work that we introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes.
Now we understand much better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feel pain or feel happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a good thing.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of complex experiences but we don't know why.
I'd like to tell you that this kind of work of neuroscience responds to some questions that we want to focus on, the questions about what certain areas of the brain are doing certain areas of the brain and what it is.
But in a sense, those are the problems.
<unk> <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problem.
Well, not the real mystery of this <unk> why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by the <unk>
Why is it a <unk>
At this point, we can't understand.
And you can say, let's take a few years to play.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon, like the <unk> as the <unk> as the life, and we're going to find it.
<unk> are all of these kinds of cases of emerging culture -- how do they operate the <unk> how they work <unk> how they are <unk> and <unk> the living organisms are questions about how to do it.
That you could apply to the human brain to explain some behaviors and brain functions like a <unk> phenomenon, how we <unk> how we speak, how we speak, how to fix it, how to deal with the behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among the problems.
But the real problem is the question of why is that all of the behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here is the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have a lot to say.
I am a human.
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> for a lot of time, and for a long time, I remembered my head against the wall by looking for a theory of consciousness in pure physical terms that work.
But at the end, I got to the conclusion that it didn't work for me.
I think we would be at this point.
So we have a chain of amazing physical innovation, wonderful and <unk> the physics explains the chemistry, the chemistry explains biology, the biology explains a part of it.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this way.
On one hand, it's a fact that we are <unk>
On the other hand, we don't know how to fix that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think that consciousness, right now is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate to our view of the world, but we don't know why.
With an anomaly like this, you can really need ideas that we need to think about, I think we need ideas that we need to be able to deal with before we deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those ideas.
My friend Dan says it's here today, has one of you.
His crazy idea is that there is no such thing as a difficult problem.
All the whole idea of the whole whole whole whole whole thing. It includes sort of an illusion of illusion or not.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the visual functions of the brain. And so you have to study everything that needs to.
Well, more power for it.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of consciousness -- <unk> <unk> based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is <unk>
But I'm in a different way.
In the time you have to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is a critical idea.
And the physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as it turns out, space, the space and the costs.
<unk> the fundamental laws that <unk> as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties are not explain in terms of anything else else.
Instead, you think it is a very difficult thing to do.
Sometimes, the list of fundamental things.
In the 19th century, it found that you can't explain the phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts of fundamental concepts <unk> space, <unk> laws of soy and <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas in terms of different ideas <unk> time, it turns out that for a question of logic and so on.
The most natural thing would be <unk> consciousness as a fundamental <unk> a fundamental <unk> of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it doesn't mean that it's not an object of science, it doesn't mean that it doesn't mean that it doesn't really mean that it doesn't mean that it doesn't mean that it doesn't mean that it doesn't mean that it doesn't mean that it doesn't mean that it doesn't mean that it doesn't mean that it doesn't mean that it doesn't mean that it doesn't
It opens the path to <unk>
So what we need is that we need to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect awareness with other concepts with other concepts -- the space, the way it works.
The physicists sometimes say that we want to look like fundamental laws that we can <unk> in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental fundamental laws that we can do in a second.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we do.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be changed.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for everyone, and every system is aware of not only humans, the dogs, the mice, the mice, even the microbes in Rob <unk> the microbes in Rob <unk>
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that the photons are smart to be smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with courtyards when you think of the speed of light.
I can never slow down.
No, that's not.
But the thinking is that maybe the fog can have some sort of sense of feeling <unk> <unk> some <unk> of consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy for you.
How could someone think something so much?
So in part of the first idea that consciousness is something that consciousness is going on.
If it's fundamental like space, the space and the emissions, is natural assume that it can also be universal as the others.
It's also worth the reason that even though the idea is <unk> it's a lot less for people in different cultures where the human mind looks more like the human mind.
One more profound reason comes out of the idea that maybe the simplest way and powerful to find fundamental laws that <unk> the thinking with the physical process is <unk> consciousness with information.
You always have that information processing data.
<unk> <unk> <unk> as a human being a human being, as a human being a human being.
<unk> of real information data.
One very exciting thing is that in the recent years that the recent years -- <unk> <unk> -- I took this kind of theory and I developed this kind of thing.
It has a measure of integration of information, which is called <unk> which measures the degree of integrated information in a system.
And he says, <unk> has to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a degree of integration of information, just like a fairly significant degree of awareness of consciousness as well.
But when you get to the ocean, there are particles, the degree of <unk>
So the level of information is like, but it's not zero matter.
So in the theory, it's still going to be a different level of consciousness there.
In fact, the fundamental law of the high level of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that the <unk> can help us integrate the human world.
Now, physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is wrong.
It led the structure of reality using a lot of experiments, but we don't talk about the reality that underlies the reality that underlies the reality that underlies it.
As an explains Stephen Colbert -- where the fire comes out of the <unk>
From <unk> vision of the physics of physics you can leave as you are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, the consciousness is that it puts fire in <unk>
In that vision, consciousness is not about the physical world as a kind of <unk>
There's the same thing.
This vision -- I think, the <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship to nature, and can have social consequences and much more.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I didn't have to eat anything that was consciousness, then I should be <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you take that vision, you'll have a lot of play.
I think that I think this tends to transform your <unk> while what it matters in terms of <unk> and <unk> moral is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and its potential.
It's also natural to ask for the consciousness in other systems, like this.
What is there about the artificial intelligence system in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of the information <unk> she has an processing processing processing information so that the answer is yes, if you will.
If this is right now, it will be very serious problems about the ethics of development in the developing computers and the ethics of <unk>
Finally, you can ask you to ask for the future.
Canada has its own <unk>
Or at a local level, a group like the audience -- as the audience at a TED. At this moment we have a TED Talk, an internal awareness for this whole group of TED -- different from the inner movies of each other.
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least this is a question that should take in serious work.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's right here.
I'm actually more sure of the first idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing, that consciousness is a fundamental thing that comes out of the second place.
The vision raises a lot of questions, and many challenges, like, how do those pieces of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and make us <unk>
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going through the right path to a theory of consciousness itself.
If not, well, it's probably the hardest problem in science and the world.
We can't wait until the night to the morning.
But I think that we finally go to it.
Remember, consciousness is the real key -- I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I grew up in a small village in London.
I had a very normal, kind of education.
I went to school, I went to school with my friends, my friends, my sisters and my friends.
all of this was very normal to me.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a prize of the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a problem.
She actually has never been there.
I went to school, I went to school, I had good ones. After school, I had a little bit on the <unk> of my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the series <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing you can think of as an exercise if we take the disability out of the brain.
Several years later, I was in the second part of teaching at a high school school in <unk> just after about 20 minutes in the class 11 years ago -- a guy raised her hand and said, "Hey, when I read your <unk>
And he said, "What <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the <unk> law for a few months.
And he said, "You know, your speech is <unk>
When people sit in front of me, they talk about things.
"Why in the classroom of <unk>
And it was then when I realized, this child had had experiences with people with disability as a <unk>
And we don't are. And it's not supposed to be true for me, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not good people, we are there for us.
And in fact, I'm on this stage -- and I ask what I do in this wheelchair -- and probably you are waiting to be waiting for you.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid of <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we have gone into a relationship to the world.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is something <unk>
It's a bad thing and live with a disability for a disability to do this.
It's not something bad and doesn't make it happen.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more of this lie through social media, through social media social media social media social media social media social communication and social media.
It's possible that you've seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before this <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
It may be you may have seen one of the little little little girl with a pencil for a pencil for the mouth.
You may have seen a child who runs with legs <unk>
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the term <unk> <unk> because it <unk> a group of people for the benefit of other people.
So in this case, <unk> <unk> in the benefit of people in the world.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, by very bad that my life, it could be worse.
I could be that <unk>
But if you are that one.
I've lost the point of the number of times that I've been <unk> <unk> <unk> believing you believe that I'm brave or a source of inspiration, and this is going to happen before my work was a virtual world.
It was as if I was in the morning and remember my own name,  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are <unk> to people with disability on the benefit of the people who don't know.
They're there so you can see and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a young person is actually a very difficult.
<unk> some things.
But the things that we do are not the things that you can think.
They're not relevant things to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> because I'm going to show you the social model of <unk> which tells us that we are more stealing because of the society that we live with because of our bodies or not.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with it.
So the things that I need to do, and I've learned to take the best of your capacity as you do, and that's what happens with the kids in those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside of it.
They're just using their bodies by taking the best of their <unk>
So it's really fair to think about the way we do it.
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells you as a result.
And I know why it is.
It's because of the fact that they have been sold for us this lie that disability has been <unk>
And I hate it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here to give you the inspiration, and you are thinking, "Why are you not going to be <unk>
And actually, I know that I know that.
<unk> of other people with disability at the moment.
However, I don't know that I'm more fortunate than them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use some <unk> <unk> to collect the things that are <unk> --  -- <unk> the clever trick of how to carry on the mobile phone battery in the <unk>
They're going up.
And of the force of the force and resistance of the other -- not against our bodies and our <unk> -- but against a world that we have.
I really think that that lie that we have sold about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us the hard.
And that includes the only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of it.
A lot of smiles in a lot of smiles at an end of the stairs haven't made it to become a <unk>
It was <unk>                 I will not be the <unk>
It wasn't a lot of people in the middle of a <unk> and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into <unk>
It's simply not going to happen.
I really want to live in a world where disability is not enough.
I want to live where a six-year-old girl, sitting sitting in his <unk> watching the <unk> <unk> not the <unk> of anything like being in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have low expectations of people with disability that we're going to be able to get out of bed and remember our names at the morning.
I want to live in a world where you value the depth of the people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child at a high school school is not a little bit surprised when their new teacher is a wheelchair user is a <unk>
The disability is not a <unk> but to question what you think about what it looks like.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
What do you have to do to see the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk>
Unfortunately, we just just respond to one of those questions, so please, please, <unk>
When people think about reality -- I think <unk> think of <unk> <unk> and in Tom <unk> the hands of the air, but it's not science fiction.
It's a lot easier is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know -- because it really helps us change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phone.
So how do we get to the <unk>
And the first step, is that I take <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows them to see what I do.
They will allow them to experience what is being a professional <unk>
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I tried <unk>
I have to use it.
I have to create a framework that you can do with your imagination.
We can use Google <unk> under a helmet and know what is running through the field of play at 160 <unk> the blood vessels.
We can know that it feels a little bit like a man of 500 pounds of liquid water.
I've been there and I guarantee it's not anything like that.
And then some videos were going to show you what the Google Google was, and you give them a sense of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practices of the <unk> because the idea of the emerging technology is a submarine to the surface. But we do what we did.
So let's see a video.
Chris <unk>
It's horrible to be <unk>
A moment.
<unk> <unk>
And it doesn't.
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's going to be <unk> in the field of paper, from the perspective of the <unk>
You have noticed that lack of people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> at the University of Congress.
<unk> <unk>
There is an example.
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to the feeling of being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> you want to do it.
<unk> you want to be in the field, be your favorite players and have asked me on YouTube and in <unk> You can't see from the angle of a <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that.
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google -- how do we go from <unk> how we bring it to the next <unk>
We took it at that level using something called something called <unk> <unk> which is probably a lot of you.
The <unk> <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever seen.
And I'm going to show you the opposite.
Man: Yes.
No, no, no, no, I don't want to follow <unk>
Oh, God bless you.
<unk> That's the experience of a man in a <unk> mountain of his life.
What will be the experience of a born when you get a little bit of <unk> <unk> on the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before you run and make a <unk> What will the experience of a <unk>
When I can be <unk> it was running out of the <unk> I put it on the bottom of the hill, or I was doing a <unk> in <unk>
What would be their experience when they were <unk> from a mountain to over 100 feet as a <unk>
Maybe you could get the sales of the city.
But this is not even <unk>
It's just virtual reality.
How do we get to the <unk>
<unk> reality is that when we speak, the <unk> and the owners look at the information of what people want to see and what's going to do this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to make it happen.
I like to leave you with that.
So here's a brief clip about technology in the <unk>
In fact, the <unk> <unk> they put a <unk> on their <unk> in order to spend more time.
And it took up to this year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, more fast.
In 1994, the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the field of field <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more <unk> because it was faster than that.
In <unk> imagine that it's a player coming back to his group and you see his next generation of you, in front of you, in front of you, on a plastic <unk> you don't have to worry about it because you don't have to worry about it.
Or to memorize the <unk>
Just go back to the field and <unk>
And the diver you want because if you don't follow their instructions, you lose them and they hate them to lose it.
If you lose yourself as well.
And they don't want that.
But humor is not just a <unk>
It's also easy. It's also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way of playing the game.
How do you do?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium -- having a view from the top of the people who are around.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that is already going on.
And all of that information is <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
the bad things will have information.
This is the good news.
So your team of computer equipment will be as important as your <unk> and the analysis of the data from being just to <unk>
It will be also to <unk> who would it be to <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that they're the <unk>
<unk> <unk>
It was a pretty complicated receptor on a wide open. All of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your <unk> <unk> that one defense behind you is going to be able to figure out what's going on, but the system of <unk>
It was going to be <unk>
Another <unk> tells you that there is a straight line.
<unk> <unk> but <unk> <unk>
And this is not the case.
You don't know where the receptor is. But the receptor looks at its <unk> an area of grass that goes on, and it can change the career.
They <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The <unk> <unk> and <unk> have been followed by each other.
This is something that we create an massive emotion in the system.
So I would give you a lot of people you see, because people want to live in that experience.
The <unk> want to be in the field of <unk>
Do you want to be your <unk>
And it was a lot easier to be part of the sport because it's too profitable to be done.
But what I ask you is, we want to look at this is the only use of the <unk>
We're going to use it just like bread and <unk> like our <unk>
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use it to encourage empathy and empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, be in the place another person.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It takes billions of dollars a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how is their actions from the perspective of the <unk>
How do this technology worth a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives being <unk>
How is it worth a <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the reality is <unk>
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face and the challenges we face, <unk>
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I would like to take you back after 23 years of service in the <unk>
Most of those 23 years in the country are <unk> the southern end of Italy, of <unk> which includes the <unk> <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure known for its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a imam for the age of being one of the most used places in the world.
The real bridge was opened up in <unk>
Joseph <unk> A <unk> engineer to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much about <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not <unk>
But from its openness, more than 80 percent of the population have escaped their death from that <unk>
Some people believe that travel between the two towers are going to be the other side of the bridge has been <unk> like that, as it turns out that every single one of them is released from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass below your own.
But let me tell you that it happens when the bridge is used to commit cancer.
After one every four to five seconds, the body lands against the water at about 120 miles an hour.
So the impact is able to turn into a few of which some of which <unk>
Most of the rest of the world.
The truth that not, usually you get <unk> in the <unk>
I don't think that the people who <unk> this method of suicide bombers would be to realize the death of the <unk>
This is <unk>
Except about the two stages -- there are 32 inches of steel here.
Here is where most people are in order to get their life.
I can tell you by experience that once the person is on the edge, and at its most dark, it's very difficult to bring back back back into it.
I took this picture last year while this guy talking with an official looking at his life.
I want to tell you that with joy that we had success that day back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any training <unk>
<unk> to channel the path through these <unk>
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> the voice as well.
We have a long way to do that.
Today, officials and psychologists train them to train new families.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at 22 volts last year having a call to get a call from a suicide bomber sitting in the sky.
<unk> and when I left, I looked at Jason talking to Jason <unk> talking to the <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, he had flown up here two times before from New Jersey to try to make it from this <unk>
After about an hour talking with <unk> we asked ourselves if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never forget that <unk>
Well, one day, the curiosity could be more <unk> and she opened up the box.
From she was <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk>
And the only good thing in the box was this.
So Jason asked us what happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> leaned on the right, and he turned it out.
So this guy named <unk> and <unk> in New Jersey had just got his life.
I spoke to the parents from Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be <unk> so because the mother of the family was called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had been there.
The damage to heart disease affect many people.
So what you need to do is, what would you do if a member of your family, a friend or loved loved <unk>
What <unk>
And <unk>
In my experience, there is no only way to speak, but you have to listen to you.
Right?
Not <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how to get it, because you probably don't have it.
It simply is there, you can be the inflection point that they need.
If you think that somebody is <unk> you won't be afraid of <unk> and do the question.
And one way to ask is to ask the question is: Why have they been thought to have been thought to be able to get these <unk>
<unk> to the person in front of it can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs at <unk> 1959, believing that things are terrible and they're never going to be <unk> to believe that there's nothing you can do to make sense of how you can do it in a very different way.
And I came up with this talk just about a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady from a lady and I would like to read their <unk>
She lost his son on his teenage January of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it is with his permission and the permission of the <unk>
<unk> I imagine you're at the TED.
It must be there.
I'm thinking that I should go on to the bridge this week. This week.
I just wanted to give you an example.
I hope you can tell many people and go home and go home talking to your friends to tell their friends, and so on.
I'm still pretty <unk> but the more times I really realize that Mike doesn't really realize that Mike won't come home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the party party with his father on his father's office.
It never got there.
He called the police of <unk> and he <unk> it as he disappeared that night.
In the next morning, two correctional officers came to my house and told me that the car car was down in the <unk>
A witness -- I had to jump from the bridge to the <unk> in the late morning.
Many thanks for those who can be able to be able to be able to be able to fight for themselves.
Who has no been going wrong without getting a real <unk>
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My whole journey is with you.
The <unk> the <unk> Foundation, which is supposed to be a ticket through our beautiful river and not an idea.
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she wanted to go to the bridge and go on the path that his son took that day, and also the value to get out of it.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, of 2005, I went to a radio call for a single woman in the middle of the bridge of the bridge in the sky.
<unk> my husband and I looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the wrist.
When I looked at it, I looked at the height of the <unk> and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the corner.
For the next hour and a half years, I heard as Kevin talked about their depression and <unk>
Kevin decided for her to realize that he would go back to that occasion, and give her another opportunity.
When Kevin <unk> it.
"This is a new moment.
But I asked him, "What did he did, and he gave it to the hope and the life of the other <unk>
And you know what I did.
He said, "I <unk> <unk>
I was asked to talk to you.
Shortly after that happened, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter and I would like to <unk>
So Mr. <unk> Nothing to erase the events of September 11, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin <unk> with us.
And I think I was thinking, I think I was <unk>
It's been diagnosed with mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
I was going to show you when I only had six months -- completely unconscious of all those traits -- but thanks to God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, like <unk>
We give God for God for you.
And in debt with you.
And at the end she <unk> <unk> when I visited General General <unk> that night, you <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I know what I had to do.
Today Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of the society.
He talks about the events of that day and of its depression with the hope that his story will inspire others.
suicide is not just something I've found at work.
It's true.
My grandfather was <unk>
And that act, despite the end of their own pain, the opportunity to get rid of it.
This is what I do.
For most people <unk> or those who think about it, they don't think of it as a person.
They simply want their own pain.
And so general, this is just about three things: drugs or alcohol or depression or death.
In my career, I've been involved and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and calls from suicide from <unk>
From those incidents that I've been directly involved in in which I have lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who spoke about an hour.
And over the time, I was <unk>
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I'm sorry, but I have to leave you with it.
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely incredible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we come up with in that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those that have come out of the bridge and lived and lived and you can talk about it, that one percent or the majority of those people have said that the second they leave side of the <unk> they realized that they had made a mistake and wanted to live in.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect to San Francisco, but also the people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that every single one of us needs to do.
suicide can be done.
There are hope.
Many thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
The world makes you like what you don't are, but in your inside you know what you are, and a question you are <unk>
I have to be something that I should be in that sense, but I'm not alone.
When I became a model that I was finally able to make the dream that I had had since I was ever done before.
My outside was finally <unk> with my real truth, with my real truth here.
For complicated reasons, what I'm going on, when I look later, when I look at this picture and I look at it, you can see it <unk>
But the <unk> <unk> discovered that I am wrong.
We all know our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of the skin or the beliefs of those who are there.
These are people who are always concerned about what they do.
In my case, the last nine years, a lot of my neighbors, many of my friends, my friends, my father, my father, my own.
I think this is called <unk>
This is me.
It was like <unk> at least because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in my house, I was always wearing this <unk> <unk> in the head.
And my mom asked me, "Why don't you always take that <unk>
I said, "It's my <unk> I'm a <unk> I'm a <unk>
I knew how to do it.
gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we now know that, really, is something that is more and more complex and better.
Because of my success, I never got to share my story, not because I thought it will be good, but why the world is going to be the world that you want to <unk>
All of the days I think.
I got my mom and family to accept me as well.
Many are not so easy.
There is a long tradition in <unk> culture, which celebrates the mystery of gender equality.
There is a whole family.
There is a <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the <unk> <unk>
I was standing in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> this is the kind of woman I want to be.
And when I was 15 years old, my man, I met this woman called <unk> <unk>
It is the fact that it is <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been in the <unk>
He told me that if he <unk> she would take off the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> and that night, he won in <unk> He won <unk> <unk> and he was a third <unk> between over 40 million.
That moment changed my life.
All of a sudden, I was in the world of <unk>
Not a lot of people can say that their first work was about two-thirds of beauty in the <unk> but I do know that.
I also met the <unk> of the <unk> especially when I was <unk> the <unk>
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my daughter who had moved to San Francisco, I called me and told me that I passed my mission to the green card that I could go to the U.S.
And I did.
I told my mother, "Why?"
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know that if you go to the United States you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to see.
My mom suggested to me that I read two <unk>
She also saved me when I was born in Thailand at 19 at age 14, at 19 at age 11.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand -- are the most sophisticated surgeries that are more <unk>
At that time in the United States, it was necessary for the surgery before the name of the name of the name and the family.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the license for the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of gender <unk>
It was a very good.
For some people, his identity means power to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
And suddenly my fears were <unk>
I felt that I could take my dream and go to New York, and to be to be a <unk>
Many are not so easy.
I think in this woman of <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living on the truth, but that, <unk> put his life back into his life.
For many of my community, that is the reality that they are.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of the 20 percent of November we do a lot of <unk> by the <unk>
I'm on this stage because of a long story of people who <unk> and stood up at the bottom.
And these are <unk>
Today, at this same time, I'm coming out of the moment.
I can't keep living in my reality and just for me.
I want to do the best way to help others live in your truth without shame, right?
I'm here, <unk> so that one day there is no more <unk> about 20 <unk>
My true truth led me to accept what I am.
What do you do?
Many thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> first, thank you very much, thank you.
My personal network of support to my parents, especially in my family -- that I think is very interesting.
I remember all of the times I have come to young women -- I think I've been <unk> and sometimes when I called me and told me that her parents couldn't afford it, he took my phone, he called my mom and said, "You can call this <unk>
Some times --  -- it's only not. It's just identity, that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
That is, to all of us that we all gave us a gender in the wild, and what I try to do is put on the table that sometimes that thing is going to go on and that there should be a space that would allow people to join the people -- and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with <unk>
The <unk> movement.
There are still a lot of money.
There should be <unk>
There should be space for curiosity and how to do questions, and I hope that all of you are my attention.
KS: Thank you.
In many cases, <unk> and <unk> the parents usually know for their children, but I'm one of the very few parents who is known for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started with the education campaign in the <unk> and when they were <unk> their efforts in 2011, the Nobel Prize for peace, was made very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but I'm now his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the story of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of the inequality, of the inequality, of violence and <unk>
You see, in traditional societies -- just from the beginning, when the first child, the birth is not <unk>
And it's not for her dad, and for his mother.
The neighborhood -- he gives his <unk> to the mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother <unk> a lot of us have a <unk>
When it gives light to the first child, the first daughter, the first daughter, the first daughter, <unk>
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, he feels guilty as a result.
Not just the mother or a daughter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when she comes to us.
At age five years ago, when I should go to school, go home and school on their own.
Up until the age of 12 years old, somehow has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move through the streets like a <unk>
But when you go into the tunnels, <unk> when it is about 13 years old, it goes up to your house without a <unk>
It's got to take the four walls of his house.
It's not a lot.
It becomes the honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if we were <unk> the code of that of that course -- it could even go away.
And it is interesting that this course is not just affecting the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of the family members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> <unk> of his life and happiness of his sisters in the name of his sisters in the name of the Second World of the course of the Second World of the world.
And there is a larger norm of <unk> which is called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl should be very <unk> and so <unk>
<unk>
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be <unk> and making the decisions of his father and his mother and his mother in the United States, even if they didn't care.
If you go to a man who doesn't like a man who doesn't like the <unk> with an old man, it has to be <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> a very young man.
Instead, the <unk>
And what does it mean?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> and then gives it to the more kids and the <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to her children.
And this vicious cycle continues and forth.
<unk> brothers and sisters, and when she was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the number one to be honest, but when I was there and I looked up and I looked at my eyes, believe me.
And so much before I <unk> I thought in her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> and he called my daughter so she called my daughter so ...
But when I was <unk> all of them were men, and I made my place, and I had a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when she came out, when she was four and a half years old, he was in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention the <unk> of a girl in a <unk>
Yes, I must <unk>
You can take for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in traditional societies in societies -- is a great event for life in the world.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name for his son.
One of the reasons to school is that it's in the world of the dreams and the aspirations where we can explore their potential for their lives.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks before, when I was <unk> the <unk> <unk> and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my students.
And the reason it was that I had never seen the names of my sisters in any family.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father could not give my sisters and his daughters, thought it had to be <unk>
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
And he got to me to go to the <unk>
And all of these values, I've tried <unk> in his personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've been <unk> all of these good values in my school for girls and kids in the world.
I used education for the <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of the <unk>
They taught students to forget the lesson of the <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found out with a new.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for the rights of women.
It was called <unk>
That means a whole lot of participation in the participation of the women in all of the economic activities of the economic activities and social activities, and social and social activities, and so on.
Hundreds of schools, including schools in schools are gone.
So girls are going to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and stopped going back to the markets.
They were <unk> the girls were <unk> and <unk>
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have about those people who sell and <unk> when you talk about their <unk>
It's really important.
At the age of 10 years ago, I got up and raised on the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the blog of observation. They were offered her it same for the New York Times, and he spoke in every platform that was born.
And his voice was <unk>
It's <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban could not tolerate their campaign and nine of October 2012, just to <unk> in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and for me.
The world became a big one.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he gave me the email to my <unk> <unk> so I went to my daughter, to your <unk>
And <unk> told me, "Please don't get <unk>
<unk> the cause of it.
<unk> your life on play for the cause of truth -- because of the cause of peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter inspired you and you <unk>
They were both on the right path and God <unk>
These few words <unk> a lot of me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was in the hospital, and I was in the hospital and I had either severe <unk> headaches because his facial nerve was <unk> I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by my face.
But my daughter has never been <unk>
I used to <unk> I love my <unk> <unk> and with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to be fine. Why don't you <unk>
It was a <unk> for us, and we did.
<unk> brothers and sisters, have learned from her how to resist the hardest moments, and I'm very pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any girl from 16 years.
<unk> when I didn't just get his job.
They fight with their brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What are you particularly special in my mentoring that has made so audacious to <unk> so often, <unk> and <unk>
I'm not going to tell you what I did.
<unk> what I did.
I don't take your wings and that's everything.
Many thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain five years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion for me.
I am a engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you that I recently joined the group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google -- but all the work I talk about today is about the science of the brain, and I made it out of my work there.
Having said this, there's a stigma when you go to a brain.
It would be just like intelligent or not?
And not to be like this, you will be able to go back to it.
Then of the <unk> I was a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't dark matter, but it was the <unk> part of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center of the center.
And then of the operation, after the operation, I had to decide what I would do, about a dozen different chemicals every day, because if I didn't take it in a few hours.
Every day, over the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations of chemicals, and of chemicals, and trying to get <unk> to continue with life.
Over once I've saved my life.
But luckily, I have a <unk> soul so I decided to try to get to try to get the doses -- because there is really no one map that I say in <unk>
I started to prove to you with different <unk> and I was struck by how small changes in the doses -- the <unk> of my <unk> -- my sense of who I was, my sense of thinking, my behavior with each other.
A particularly interesting case -- for a few months -- I tried to doses and chemicals for a man in a row, and I was in looking at how I was going to look at it.
I was always thinking about all the time in sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  -- and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past I've met several kinds of <unk>
It turned out as a result.
But my great surprise was that I was not trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> to fix a problem that had a problem that was in front of them.
So I couldn't fly.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience I gave me a new appreciation for men and about what they have to do is to get me better with men.
What he was trying to do was to bring those drugs to the <unk> and whoa. and yet, it was to recover my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my <unk> and my <unk>
<unk> to think almost in images, and that became my point of view of how these mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not a new kind of thoughts it's not.
<unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> you see things in different ways.
It tells us that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
Now, there are some people who are doing this idea, and there are many discussions about how the mind. I work on how the mind. I can be simple for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to <unk>
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have already a lot of great <unk> and I really have a lot of great <unk> and so on.
Now, I'm working on how it will take very fast pictures of my mind on my mind to the screen of the computer.
You can imagine what would happen if a film director would be able to use its imagination only to lead the world to the world that has to be.
Or if a musician could get the music of his <unk>
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way people creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is that, the only difficulty to get this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain systems.
So let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments that are made by two major groups in between.
They both used a 3D scan of synthetic MRI devices to represent the brain. Here you can see the brain scan made by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left-hand column shows the scan of the brain of a person who looks at an image.
The column of the middle column is showing the brain scan of the brain in the same individual as you can see that same image.
The column on the right side was created by the content of the central column of the left column on the left, you see that the difference is almost <unk>
So this is a <unk> in many different individuals with many different images with many different images with a similar question.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that same picture is almost <unk>
Now, let me tell you another experiment -- this is the laboratory of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They were able to turn out to turn the brain out into visual space.
Let's take this way.
In this experiment, it showed people a bunch of hours of YouTube videos while they were <unk> their brains to create a large amount of reactions in the brain at the same time.
And then I showed you a movie with new ideas, new animals, new animals, and as much as it was <unk> a new <unk>
So the computer, using the brain information to show you what it looks like to show what the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that comes in.
This gave us <unk>
We're good at it.
We just need to improve it.
And now, remember, when you see an image and when you imagine that same picture, you can imagine that in the brain the same <unk>
This led to the brain stem systems of greater resolution available today, and its resolution is a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution for a thousand times more to get a look at how to get a look at the <unk>
How do we do that?
There are lots of techniques to do it.
One is to open up the skull and put it on.
I didn't give it to you.
Many of you are using new new techniques for images, even I was <unk> with the recent result of the test, first of the later, this technology will be the end of the day.
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with <unk> but at this point, including more <unk> just offer small improvements in the resolution, not <unk> for thousands of reasons.
I put this idea: instead of <unk> we do better than that.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different, like making a <unk>
And why is this important?
In the last few years, a huge amount of effort in MRI were to make really big <unk>
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> solutions and brilliant <unk> in <unk> and <unk> in <unk> and <unk> in the Horn of America, in the developing world.
At its time instead of a magnetic field -- <unk> magnetic field patterns -- <unk> <unk> to the frequencies of <unk>
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the temperature processing processing processing processing using <unk> we can increase the information that you can get in a single <unk>
In addition, we can divide our growing knowledge over the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the billions we need.
By using the <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood vessels -- but the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that I've mentioned -- and maybe even the neural activity, this is the dream.
We should be able to build our ideas in direct ways.
You can imagine if we could go over of language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we do?
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is something new.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> as a tool for us to reflect on our physical thinking.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and disease.
We have a few options to open this door.
Anyway, they nominate a year, they will be five or 15 years ago.
It's hard to imagine that it will be much better.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about this night from the <unk> and not only in a traditional sense, not just about it.
I think we all have <unk>
His self is probably telling some person for the first time that his love or telling someone who's pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or anything else that has cancer, or any other conversation that you have in life.
All of this is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have come out of that -- is something they were doing.
He doesn't like it, and we don't like it.
Many years ago, I was working in the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go to various positions of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it will be the slope of the <unk> of my little <unk> and I have <unk> the head I did -- I would like to ask you a little bit of a little bit or <unk>
And I was absolutely uncomfortable with that.
<unk> my <unk> a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> the newspaper and the mother pointed out a little bit of a <unk> look at his child.
But I would not say anything, and I would say <unk>
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years old, I was ready to go.
And that's a wonderful idea.
So I promised that the next time I would say something.
It would be that very difficult.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A familiar silence but this time I was engaged and I was at the end of the table at the table.    I had online quotes of Betty <unk>
And this is the perspective.
Even a clip of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
And so I went back and I went on and I put it on and I got a little kid, and I got a little kid, and I thought, what is not a challenge for a <unk>
And so I went back again and I put it back out of it, and I said, "Hey, do I know that this is something <unk>
I have the short hair as a child, and you see clothes, but I am a girl, but I am a girl, and you know, like you like to use a biologist, and sometimes you like to use a <unk>
All right, I'm more of the kind of girl in a company.
And that little girl looked at me by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite paper is <unk> and it has a fish.
I can give you a <unk>
And that was everything.
What about the <unk>
It was the very easy conversation that I never had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, we were now <unk> one with each other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, I often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside the dark, you can't know what color looks like.
You only know how a feels like to live in a row.
It's just like my self is not different from you.
<unk> will give you 100 reasons why I come out of my life was more difficult to get out of the country, but this is the <unk> the hard time is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who has declared someone who has declared their own <unk> is more difficult to say that it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is more difficult to tell your son five years that you go to <unk>
There is no more difficult thing to do right now.
We need to get rid of what we have to do with what hard to do to another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we should just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
In some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make security, or at least more safety than what the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what they are made of their walls, one is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine 20 years ago.
I, I mean, I had a horse, a <unk> and <unk> shoes of <unk>
It was not the bad thing to fight against any of the four year-old boy who would walk into the coffee.
I was struck by fear and <unk> in a corner of my dark corner of my house, and I was gay, and the only muscle is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my friends, young young young strangers who I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was turned back into the world.
I was burning up the pages of a <unk> that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk>
One of my favorites is a little bit easier for me to do it was in my life.
It was the first time that many of them were forced to do it was gay, and when I was doing my job <unk> and I was going to show you around the tables and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who knew I knew I knew about.
And after speaking to you a moment, one of the women is <unk>
And the battle of gay rights had changed.
We had ever been on the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is, we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we have never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
So what is your TV program <unk>
And our <unk>
And you know who we are.
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but instead of showing his support, I desperately wanted to know that I was on my side, finally said <unk> "Well, sometimes my husband is <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, like you have all the <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to tell you where it was <unk>
It's not really hard to get out and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else else you can ask someone, you can ask someone, you can ask someone, right?
If you're going to be authentic with someone, you have to be prepared to be prepared for the story.
It's just like the hard conversations are going to be my point.
Just to anybody with anyone who has <unk>
But I'm <unk> and I keep doing what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please see this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it means to be out of any -- is essentially the same thing.
<unk>
<unk> <unk>
That little girl in coffee had no legs, but I was ready for the <unk>
If you want somebody to be <unk> the others have to know that they also have to know that they also have to know who they are.
Number two: Sean <unk>
If you know that they're gay, <unk> <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they might be gay, they will keep the hope that it could change.
They don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and most of them --  Thank you very much.
You communicate its true.
It was <unk> by that.
And some of you may be aware of what they have done, but they will never be raped by what they are.
And yeah, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that's something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not <unk>
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is what you want to do.
So the next time you find out in a dark space, you have a <unk> you have to know that we all have been there before.
And it may be very simple. It's not true.
Thank you.
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how it has seen intelligence, a productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of if a machine can think about is as interesting as the question of if a wooden can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> he wrote it as a critical <unk> to the <unk> as Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, <unk> a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
If you go back a minute.
First we start with an artificial experience.
Imagine that they are a <unk> which you don't know about the biology biology or the neuroscience of the Earth or the Earth of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and you can see the Earth, and you can see the Earth, so you can see the Earth during millions, even billions of years.
And you see a lot of it.
Of course, as we speak, we know that the reason it would be that we are trying to save ourselves.
We are trying to avoid an impact.
But if they are from a magical race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept on Earth, it would be forced to develop a physical theory that will explain how, to a certain moment in time, the asteroids that we <unk> the surface of a planet <unk>
And so I claim that this is the same question that the physical nature of understanding nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led to a variety of years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, to a single mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be able to stand up to the development of intelligence, and in particular, for developing states that we <unk> the diversity of the potential of possible change.
Finally, in the spirit of the robotic movement there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future of action in order to do complex things.
And so, taking all of these different topics and <unk> together, I thought, for several years, there's a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for the <unk>
And I think the answer is <unk> What you're looking at is probably the closest equivalent to a <unk> and a <unk> <unk> for the intelligence that I have.
So what you're looking at here is a statement that intelligence is a strength, which acts in order to maximize the future of action.
In order to maximize the future freedom of action, or keep the open choices with the diversity of possible diversity with the diversity of possible future, we might be a <unk>
In a few words, we don't like to get <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future of action and keep the real choices there.
And so, if you realize this equation, it's natural to tell what you can do with this.
What do we do?
<unk> the level of intelligence.
<unk> intelligence is <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, show some of the amazing applications of this simple idea.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more <unk> or <unk> during their life should have become more favorable to the existence of smart beings like us.
But what if that connection to <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence is a more <unk>
What if the intelligent behavior is not only correlates with the long-term entropy production, but it actually comes directly out of it.
To find out, we have developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the long-term entropy of the long term.
And finally, <unk> could pass multiple evidence of animal intelligence, play games of humans, and even earn money -- all of it -- all of that without being able to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human foot <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> <unk> a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave it to us.
I just decided to get the <unk>
This ability of equilibrium will have applications for modern robotics and human culture.
This ability of tools will have applications of tools will have applications on the intelligent manufacturing will have applications in the manufacturing system.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling out of extremes of the <unk> of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of that <unk>
So this capacity of cooperation has been interesting to be interesting for the economic <unk> and in a variety of other ways.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see a video game playing a game of <unk> -- <unk> its potential for the game for the game for the game, <unk>
So here we are looking at <unk> unlike new connections in a social network where friends are constantly <unk> and continues to success the network right now.
So this same capacity of <unk> also has applications in health care care, in energy care and intelligence.
So here we see <unk> organize the routes of a fleet of boats, finding out with success and using the sanctity of the universe, to expand the global level from the Atlantic to the North Pole.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense of us.
And finally, here we see <unk> and we found out and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a series of trials that were <unk> in a couple of weeks.
This ability to risk risk will have changed in finance and <unk>
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of cognitive views of cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all of which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
here is a profound <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the term for the term <unk> the <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if <unk> machines, there would be a <unk>
<unk> <unk>
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of civil war.
It's not that machines are very smart and then <unk> and then we try to take the world.
It's all that the momentum of taking control of all the possible future is an most fundamental principle that the general intelligence of the intelligence, that general intelligence can actually have made control of control, rather than being the same.
Another important consequence is the search for the goal.
I often tell me how to look for goals of this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to go to the descendants of helping to help build films or to help help understand human intelligence, the intelligence must be seen as a physical process.
Many thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
We are at an inflection point in human history, something between human history, and to lose the planet we call <unk>
At the last few years, we've expanded our knowledge of how the Earth works in the context of the universe.
The Kepler <unk> mission has discovered thousands of possible planets that occur around other stars, which points to the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy, our galaxy.
It is a space telescope that measures the <unk> intensity of stars when the planets pass through each other, and they'll take a little bit of that light that we make.
The data generated by Kepler is showing the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there is between them and their mother.
So together, this helps us understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their bodies.
At its time this day, this gives you clues about if these planets that we find are <unk> or not.
Unfortunately, while we are finding this <unk> of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
Last year, it was the largest one.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for us are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we have caused global scale in our global scale -- we also have our ability to fix their course.
But I'm not a scientist at the climate change.
But we study the <unk> of the planet through the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where we find life beyond our planet.
You could say that I look at positive opportunities in the market.
Now, as somebody really interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more we look at planets like the Earth, more than the other planet.
Every one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the first planet, and the planets that we know about our solar system.
Let's take our <unk>
So Mars is little and <unk> and despite being a little bit further away from the Sun, it can be considered a global world that has been shown by a mission like that.
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been on the past and part of the past and part that's why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> as the <unk> of our surface is looking for clues about clues about the origins of life as we know.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission -- take samples from the atmosphere -- and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose its <unk>
The private companies now offer not just a short video flight -- but also the possibility of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images are remind us the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas and <unk> compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still in <unk> places that are actually <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the most abundant places in the world, the air is cool and much more <unk> and much more <unk> from our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement through the tangle of Mars and other planets like this, and so I got a great <unk> and sad <unk> and that belief in some that Mars and the belief in some of these <unk> <unk> the only planet that we know is truly critical.
For a lot of you, I like to talk to you today about <unk>
There are lots of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to <unk> the humanity is as if the captain of the Titanic will comment on that the party actually goes later later on the <unk>
But the goals for exploration are <unk> and <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments here in our world look like <unk>
You only find more about it.
If we can understand how to create and keep spaces in the rich areas and the <unk> of the land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with an experiment -- the paradox of it.
Many years ago, a lot of years ago, the Islamic physicist was asked to realize that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the existence of <unk>
Well, where are you?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider to be living in the stars, they lose the notion of how important the planets that are going to protect the planets that we need.
It's <unk> to think that just the impossible, <unk> us to save us from ourselves, but culture and exploration and <unk> can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to put the wrong environments on Mars for the human presence for the presence of the human presence then we should be able to overcome the <unk> even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
A few years ago, I was a few years old.
And while I was on the porch on the porch by looking at my pockets, I realized that I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were at the table of <unk> where there were <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and all of them were very low.
I thought to call it a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to come up with it, and I did it.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff to go home because I had an early flight to Europe in the next morning, and I would like to share with my passport and my colleagues.
<unk> expensive, but you sure don't more expensive than a <unk> one night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, they had a good idea.
I'm a profession of profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works.
<unk> <unk> which increases your heart rate -- the levels of stress.
And when I arrived in <unk> in the airport, I realized that I had no idea that I had no idea.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without thinking about it.
And I started to wonder if there was something that could be done, systems that I could put in their place, that would be <unk>
Or at least, if you look at things like this: the probability of the probability that it is such a result.
So I got to think about that, but to a month after a month after my thoughts in my life.
I was sitting with my colleague, Danny <unk> Prize winner and a little bit <unk> I talked about the window, and that I had forgotten my mom and Danny shared with me that I had been doing something called <unk> <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years before, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk>
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts comes up and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as explains the <unk> you look forward and trying to figure out all the things that might go wrong, then try to figure out what it can do to prevent the things that are wrong or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so easy.
I'm going to start with that.
At the home, I <unk> a place for the things that you lose here.
This sounds like common sense and it is, but there are a lot of science that you know, this is based on how our memory works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a <unk> of the location of important things, where the fish, where the fish are <unk> where the fish are living and <unk>
And the hippocampus is the part of the brain that is <unk> in the <unk>
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their <unk>
And if you ask if somebody really did the experiment, it would make sense of the <unk> and even so you could find their <unk>
They were not using the <unk> but the hippocampus, that a very evolved mechanism in the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move too much, not so good for things that move too much.
This is the reason to lose your car, read your car, read and <unk>
So at home, a place for keys, a <unk> next to the door, maybe a <unk>
So for his friends.
So for his goggles -- a little <unk>
If you take a place and you're <unk> with it -- you will always be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take with the cell phone picture of your credit card credit card <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to themselves so that they're in the <unk>
If these things are <unk> or <unk> this can facilitate it.
These are some of the most exciting things.
Remember, when it's under stress, the brain frees up.
The <unk> is amazing.
