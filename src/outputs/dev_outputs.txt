You know what I do is write for children, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children, more reading in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> like <unk> or with leather clothes, and nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that a epiphany is usually something that fell somewhere else.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the complicated kind of circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle school in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare class.
When I went to bleed every week in the <unk> bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the room for the women's room.
I did it in secret, it.
Two for three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
I had a thumb, and a 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the years, I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, I got a phone call of that <unk> <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm guessing that adults never get to know us.
You could go to Ohio, and please bring that guy that I know you've found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I'd like you to leave you with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we were <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
And we found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> us from his family, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman I wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> it became a box of cinders and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked to you about it was made in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save it.
And you know that that part of life needs all the rest of life.
It needs true and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It needs -- it needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what I was in front of me.
I cut them around 60 feet from water almost 60 meters -- and I couldn't think it was a <unk> of snow on another <unk> year after year.
The <unk> are born when you fall out of the glaciers or the ice walls.
Every iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to give up and hold up to the end, while others can't afford it, more and <unk> in a <unk> passionate passion.
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and themselves, largely as we see ourselves as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> <unk> I'm breathing your atmosphere <unk>
As an iceberg melts an iceberg releases fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way, and they will never exist in that way.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of their way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice in the <unk> I photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I'd like to show you is from a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's a little frequent to get to witness an iceberg <unk>
Here it is.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your line of <unk>
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an iceberg of an average <unk>
<unk> water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so he <unk> the iceberg showing a different side of your personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single baby <unk>
So, two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to stand too much in the details of conception, because if they stop thinking of consciousness itself, I'm not going to pay attention to it.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in one case, the <unk> and the sperm is joined the X chromosome.
And in the other case, the X X of the sperm joined the X chromosome.
Both of them <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my activity that I could have two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the story of anatomy.
I am a <unk> of training, and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- which is to say, human bodies -- and how they have considered the body fluids -- the idea of <unk> what have thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've been working with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with twins.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than average.
And I've worked with a lot of cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physics doesn't fit into male and male <unk>
In general lines, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> adopted many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that doesn't fit into male or male forms or female.
For example, there's the case of the individual based on <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene <unk> and it tells the <unk> that we all have in life -- that we all have in the <unk> life that gets <unk>
And then, in the <unk> life, the testes are producing testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high levels of testosterone but not reaction.
As a consequence, the body is developing, following a course of typically females.
When the baby is <unk> the baby looks like a child.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast -- but it doesn't have the amount of time, when someone realizes something is happening.
After doing test tests realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and a y chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women, like men, like men, have in the body something called <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like me -- I consider a woman. I don't know his <unk> structure, I think being a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has <unk> syndrome.
So sex is something complicated. It's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some ways they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19 year-old boy born and raised like <unk> had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, he was wearing a life as a boy and he had just found out he had <unk>
It had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
It had central chromosomes and the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that, essentially, they were essentially creating a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, their <unk> were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> anything.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started having medical problems by internal <unk> when doctors found that, in fact, it was a woman in the inside.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> which is -- they have <unk> tissue wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are lots of varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- it's <unk> twins, or <unk> twins, and <unk> surgery -- it's not to be able to have a better physical health better.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why it was <unk> several surgeries is that it's a threat to our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that an particular anatomy brings <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have an identity -- it's going to be black to be black, you mean having African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic.
And when you presented with us a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the <unk> very romantic.
Imagine the amazing thing that is to have children that are born like two people inside one body.
The most highest case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> put in fabric of his sex in the <unk> <unk>
Many journalists called me to wonder: "What test are going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there's no such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are we who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, the more we need to admit that these categories -- as we thought were stable <unk> categories that are <unk> directly into <unk> categories, they are much more <unk> than they are.
And not just in sex.
Also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with the chimps.
What about the fact that <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we believe in science we become more and more in a awkward area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably too <unk> are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are fighting at the beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to fix a moment from which a body becomes human and has a different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today, not in public, but I know within the <unk> to when someone is considered died.
Our ancestors had never had to leave them with this question if somebody was dead.
As a lot was to put a pen in front of the nose, and if she moved it on, he still didn't get it.
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for instance, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we need to deal with the dilemma of determining really human death, and this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories.
And you might think that this explosion of categories might be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm liberal, <unk> to people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it makes me nervous.
<unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about it.
It was <unk> from the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of the Parents <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, I find every bit of watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is completely <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with the Parents <unk>
Parents -- they were, to me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they did is that they <unk> it was a <unk> concept, and I repeated it with another that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as everybody remember, what we did -- our parents <unk> was the idea of <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The other monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was coming into the right of the blood of the blood of the father and the father and then the son, etc.
The Parents -- I rejected that idea and replacing it by a new concept of <unk> and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the field camp and they decided that the anatomy that cared about was the anatomy in common and not <unk> <unk> That was very radical.
And in part they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the history of the Parents -- that many were very interested in science and the idea of a world <unk>
They were <unk> from <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of being able to be passed through a vague <unk> idea.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look at, for example, the Declaration of <unk> they talk about nature and from the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in consequence we were passing into the idea of <unk>
And when we do that, they were <unk> the foundations of the future movement of Human Rights movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women are <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights Movement with <unk> people who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the ranks of the Civil Rights movement.
And again, people of color that we engage in <unk> <unk> about the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For instance, I don't want to give a fish the same rights as a human.
I don't want to say that we should be <unk> with anatomy.
I don't want to say that the five year-old kids were supposed to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me to make sense and I think we should support them.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things that were going on at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before we time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, on the other hand, was born in term: <unk> was <unk>
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary was attributed to all three months before to Henry the right for sex -- sex by vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
And Henry, at virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> at virtue of being considered a man now to be <unk> the power <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, on your hand, it doesn't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So still <unk> <unk> categories that in various ways are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science was moving both in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a <unk> democracy could <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time I feel like science <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It seems like what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to map the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For instance, Texas at some point has decided to marry a man you don't have to have chromosome, and that to marry the woman you have to have <unk>
Now, in practice, they don't do tests to treat people.
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you about the beginning of the <unk> syndrome to the <unk>
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I would "I love a solution.
He says that we should judge people <unk> not on the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks very good.
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we should be involved in this to <unk> rights to people, because I have to admit that I know of some <unk> <unk> that probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent and intelligent decisions about their sexual activity, than the people of 40 I know.
So how do you put the theme of the content of <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And one part of me asks what if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current thinking in relation to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men are susceptible to being killed, unless they are willing to submit to a sense of sex, in which case you can live in.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that he had made birth to light twins to then pick it out, and then they take their fame.
But when the phone was asked by the phone, he was a very <unk> operation -- he said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore he had to do it.
And I said, "Well, it's considered political seekers rather than <unk>
America offers huge possibilities for people to be who are <unk> to change for the state of state.
So I think we need to be on the head.
Well, to end I want to say that I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy, or as it might have been, if we had more involvement <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a <unk> and that is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about groups.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in investigating the sexual difference.
And one of the things that I've been interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about studying studies is that women on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and care about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in grad school, one of my <unk> I knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I thought I was <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> What's the <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes <unk> so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I've ever thought about your question, the more I think there's something female on the <unk>
I mean, there could be something, on average, something different between the feminine brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the parents were very attentive to find the way to protect people over the state, it is possible that they had gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection for the support of <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we raise democracy beyond <unk> think less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and to think more about relationships.
So as we try to create a perfect union of what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In the year 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where to go to live and work, they have a chance to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this point, we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth much more than their cost of building cost.
So we could easily go through the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if they've never thought about new cities.
But it just <unk> through the apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartment were already owners and that the other half is still not <unk>
They could try to increase the ability to increase <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that you want, is that those buildings and the areas surrounding the world have rules to avoid the <unk> and the construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all of those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place, building a whole particular apartment building -- always and when the rules of that place <unk> the construction instead of putting them down.
So I proposed that governments are working new areas of reform enough to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 seconds, they will come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> happened by a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the next election elections -- <unk> <unk> was invited by a platform in which we <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of testing with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to its most essential.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that say you can't go and annoy for all the current residents of apartments.
We have a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes a lot of technologies like rules for <unk> and usually the rules that keep us moving forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala was sent to <unk> a link for <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than the cost of the cost.
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City, in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms, that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that would <unk> the rules that <unk> there and an option so that people can choose if they want to go under those norms.
So the president of <unk> I called me and said that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk again about four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was about explaining that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that will measure at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I felt and showed the <unk>
And this <unk> <unk> that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that you might be going to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away from the North.
And also <unk> new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help from countries <unk> they could benefit from the countries associated with them to help establish and make the rules of the <unk> so that everybody could rely on the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw one site.
This picture is from there.
It could be easily 1,000 square miles.
And little later, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to protect their Constitution, and add a constitutional arrangement that would allow these special special regions to be made.
In a country that had just passed through this <unk> crisis voting in Congress for this constitutional constitutional constitutional constitutional <unk>
All of them parties, all of them in society, <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17 is passed over again in another voting of <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting on the 21 to 24 in February, a delegation of 30 <unk> was to the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that's building in Korea, is larger than the center of Boston.
All you see there was built in four years, after it was four years and getting the <unk>
The other thing was interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've been built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this practical, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> <unk> and then would allow the <unk> to operate under a external legal system.
A country has committed to allow the Supreme Court to be the last sentence for this new <unk> system.
There are urban and builders, cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know you've already solved is they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies who wanted to move in the <unk> especially in a place with a free trade zone, and there's a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately somewhere else.
There's a million a year coming out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family to go to get a job -- sometimes they are alive mothers who have to earn money for just eating or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes even there are children who are trying to meet with their parents that they haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what would you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all around the world?
What does it seem to think about insisting that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> was asked to say, "Thank TED <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there are in the inside, I'm going to make a confession public -- and I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, and more recently, photograph and publish my blog suits, colorful and different for every time.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets, and the second hand.
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores that allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to meet people -- usually my money is going to be a good <unk> My look is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be from my size?
I'm going to like color <unk>
Less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
To go back to my <unk> I want to tell you what I was doing for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings up with someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of underwear, and nothing else.
It's all I've put inside for a week is everything I've put in my <unk>
I imagined that I would be able to find everything else that I would like to use after getting here to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman walking for TED in inner underwear,  -- that means I found a few things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound that interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this journey of not using new clothing.
Start with the Sunday.
I call this brilliant tiger tiger here.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You always can see you can see it phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including <unk> cost me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing that I've used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a brilliant red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
Just yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just give you a little bit of it."
<unk> <unk> of the boy who put inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remember her <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you're looking at something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't see yourself with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your interior and outside, there's no look at you that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to achieve.
Thank you.
<unk> universal truth six words for you. The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style, and it's a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it over and over again when people were approaching me just this week by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is obviously not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, in Brooklyn, I'm going to give everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you need to leave certain things.
I don't need emotionally emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> and <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there is a little love in my heart, and I came up.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the logical part, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For instance, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who's totally intuitive.
So where do you get your brain on this scale?
Some of the <unk> for one of these ends, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something like this -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not a mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, which just like most of the other quantum physical physicists -- we need a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put it to play with them and then we see how <unk> and then we see our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that you can have developed with the step of the years is that one thing says that one thing can be only in a place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you were not born with this <unk> the <unk>
I remember watching a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a small child, and he didn't do it very well, he always <unk>
But I bet you play with that <unk> bar that taught him a valuable lesson, and that is that the big things don't allow the <unk> to stay in a place.
This is a big conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a physicist from particles.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with parking bars -- they play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of things that are really strange -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it quantum mechanics.
At that point it was the physics of a few years -- you need to get quantum mechanics to describe these little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, no one saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit very well to my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the little particles follow the early principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow the principles of mechanical <unk>
I don't find the reason why I should.
And therefore I would feel much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been on a quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to scale it a little bit like it is right in the center.
And then here we do a good approach to the small metal <unk>
What we see is a little little bit of metal, a springboard and a springboard and <unk> <unk> on a platform.
And then I did this almost in the same way that a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a chip. And I went to work all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole with a swimming form of swimming underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be on quantum sensors, but to do it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am in an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people go up, I leave you from doing those things, because I don't want them to <unk> it or actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The partners on the journey of inanimate objects are not only people, it's also the light that we <unk> and the wind that happens to its side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we'd have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and pulled the air out and pulled it into a temperature of less than one degree on zero zero.
Now, when you're only in the <unk> the small piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measure its movements.
We found it moved on in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, I was vibrating. And the way it <unk> was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft motivation, we were able to make it <unk> and they didn't react at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, every trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal are still up and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just at certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time, they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> the <unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that little bit of metal is more or less the same piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, it's my kind of logic that you talk about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when I <unk> it and we turned the lights and look inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in one piece.
And I was able to get to this new intuition, seemingly all the objects in the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are just shown in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics -- claims it's all interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
That's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my head that's here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months.
A lot of negotiations and stories, you know, with 17 very interesting museums of nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There are lots of stories of why we did.
I think my own story is just explaining to this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- I didn't get <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and going into museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to do it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
Better than it shows the demo to then tell you a couple of interesting things that we've done since their launch.
So, <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's gallery <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the Van <unk>
I'm actually going to get into one of my favorites, <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and get stuck.
They want to navigate for the <unk>
We open up the top, and then with one click, we jumped in.
They're inside, they want to go to the end of the room.
Let's keep going. Which is <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows you the picture, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I believe, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels.
It can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see things that are going on.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really wish to <unk>
So I started playing play, and I found something that was going on there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems to be <unk>
I walked in, and I discovered that the kids were actually playing something.
And so I did a little bit of research, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick on the Tuesday night.
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did it, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get to get deeper into depth and you'll see that you can actually reach the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pull the image, so you really see what's there.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So we're going to quickly jump over again at MoMA, in New York.
Here's another favorite of my favorites, <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Gogh actually created this <unk> work.
It goes up and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this painting, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> night -- I think I had never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite features here.
There are a lot of things over here, but I don't have time for <unk>
This is the really cool part, it's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely all, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online create your own museum, to create your own collection of all these images.
It's very simple, we walked -- I've created this function that I call "The <unk> of the <unk> we just made a zooming in it.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Portrait Gallery.
You can write things, send you to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things don't really come from Google.
No, in my view, even as well.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope in this digital environment justice to its artwork and that is represented properly online.
And the big question that you do today is you have done this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon everybody.
So I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> a <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'll tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, Italian, all the children in Italy grow up with this picture on the wall of your bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it's been something very interesting in the careers of Formula 1 in the last two decades.
So some time ago, if you wanted to win a career of Formula one, I would take a budget and put it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the race.
This is what it is in engineering that is in engineering control system for real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the real-time control systems are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're becoming <unk> computers.
And as <unk> they're beginning to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is something big.
As if you can tell you that cities are only two percent of the cortex on the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the population <unk>
75 percent of the <unk> consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be something big.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition by <unk> <unk> for weekends at <unk> during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start <unk>
In a way, it is like almost all the existing atoms -- they were getting sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that we like humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> he says he took the hammer and he threw it to the Moses -- you can still see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just some <unk> insisting on the idea of getting the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection of this.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four and a half years in Italy.
It was a summer with luck in 2006.
It was the year in which Italy won the World Cup in the World.
Maybe some of the remember, it would play Italy and France, and at the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now let's look at what happened that day by looking at what happens in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the Athabasca River.
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is at the top.
On the late afternoon there are people over here and there were call calls <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a quick call and go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She makes Italy, yeah!
That night, everybody went to <unk>
There you see the big summit.
The next day, everyone went to the center of the winner and the first minister at the time.
And then all the world's <unk>
Do you see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time you <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the city pulse in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and we consume them.
Today we know all about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the chips that make up a Mac, how it <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash into their shift by the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more about a year ago, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that can all <unk>
And then we put a little chip, a little chip, a little chip, and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
After a week.
We realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with a lot less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're happening very complicated, and there's so much <unk>
But the other thing we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we dropped not away is still somewhere on the planet.
If the bottle of plastic that we dropped on a day is still there.
And if we show that to people, then we can promote some behavior change.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague of MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about sensing and many other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is <unk> about the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and south of Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public spaces.
And the question was, how do the technology, the new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas we developed at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine that they have a <unk> and you have a <unk> tubes of <unk> <unk> <unk>
It creates a curtain of water, with the pixels of water.
If you go down the pixels and you can write patterns, show patterns, images, text.
And by zoom in, the curtain will open up so we can happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor of mayor of <unk>
He liked it a lot.
And they took a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it a <unk> <unk>
The entire building is made of water.
There is no doors or windows -- but when you come up with it, it opens up so you can go through.
The roof is also covered with water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> your roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture goes away.
Those days, there will always be someone, in the winter, when the roof, somebody who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when you get down almost the whole architecture away.
Here it is working.
It looks at people <unk> so what happens in the inside.
And here I am trying to try and test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all of the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children in <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you go, but a building that still <unk> and holes in water, and you had to jump up for not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as the architects, engineers, designers, we always think about using our designs.
But then reality is being unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact with it.
This is a picture of the building with the pixels of physical pixels and the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine that you could have little helicopters in the air and each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, and imagine a helicopter, which is moving with others in sync.
We could form this cloud,
And a kind of flexible screen like this with a very flexible configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, what it changes is the light, not the <unk> position.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen would appear in different scales and sizes, different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that would be able to make a spider pixels in 3D where you can get near and look at from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the lights lights look like this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of ballet dancers today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture its 3D movements and use it as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> the <unk> in different <unk>
It's so much 3D <unk> in real time as it capture.
It can spread all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels and we can play with them, with the color and the color, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> farm like <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could do all of us <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can move through the digital world of the <unk> of the <unk> of the networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are the pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but on the pixel
You can move inside the inside, you have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to be able to share the main moments of the 2012 Olympics and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection to the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can get into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone that goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what are they?
Suppose I told you that, with only some changes in their genes, they could improve the <unk> for more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you might want to be more strong, be stronger than being <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and sure of themselves?
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe be these people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is it the most <unk>
What would you like, if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people are <unk> creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> probably had to be the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you chose <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of us -- that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something of this the world that would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe this is possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference.
The great pattern, of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote a trial called "Nothing to be except for the light of <unk>
But if you really embrace biological evolution consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
Does it mean the other or to us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well on one end, is, of course, what interests us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years.
There have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of you have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, mostly the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same underlying protein, which is where it comes from.
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all take in the lower gut that the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, do you think -- when Antonio <unk> to tell you about the <unk> you think about <unk>
So the gut is a wonderfully controversial environment, for those bacteria.
It's very dark, dark away, it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide them all the nutrients that you can want to have no effort on their part.
It's really like a quick thing to bacteria with the occasional occasional occasional occasional occasional rush of <unk>
But so on, we're a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they're essential to our life.
They help us digest nutrients nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what about the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something maybe better adapted to <unk>
In this vast symphony symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one and only <unk> and human life, a small note.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you have <unk>
When I first went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in <unk> organisms -- every cell is simply <unk> and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to the two daughters.
But when the diarrheal organisms, things start to change.
It goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of death of the body comes into evolution in the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to convince you that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> death of <unk> it looked pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every time I had more doubt.
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still entered Las Vegas well in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits her <unk>
He opens the door.
In front of him you find a slight <unk> dancer.
And he looks at it and he says, <unk> in search for a <unk> <unk>
He said, "I say, George, I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working on a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted you to get healthy <unk>
I wanted to get health into the disease.
I wanted we to live more and more more than we live.
Evolution consists of going through the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary view of view, you and I are like rockets -- designed to send the genetic burden to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think we all <unk> the feeling that expressed Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you don't know.
Evolution doesn't necessarily benefit longevity.
It doesn't necessarily kill the bigger or the harder or even the most clever.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the bacteria <unk> that they can survive the heat of the <unk> that we would find if there were fish there, fish empty in the empty, yet they have managed to make that an <unk> environment.
So what does this mean? When we look at what's happening in evolution and if we think about the place of humans in evolution in evolution, and in particular, if we look at the <unk> phase -- I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the reasoning. reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and made of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment for us to adapted to us as well as we adapt to him.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and we become so excited that it's no longer possible to have the necessary isolation that evolution.
A second possibility is that there's a evolution of traditional <unk> sort of dictated by nature's forces.
And the argument here is, that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as <unk> when as a species <unk> distant planets are going to exist the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution naturally.
But there's a third possibility, a possibility -- intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and <unk> for us as individuals in the choices that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First consider the reality of a lot of people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society but is what it takes at the individual and family level.
Think of it as well as possible to be able to choose not only sex of your <unk> but in their own body to make the environmental adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
Don't want to make those changes in their <unk>
If we look at the future, that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and sued 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs to a human genome at the cost of 20,000 and a week.
Not much for the fact that the human genome is going to be done, and it's getting more and more at all.
You get those changes.
The same technology which has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect them from themselves, but they are going to induce <unk>
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in course with the vaccine against flu <unk> in cells from a <unk> plant.
You can imagine something nice about the <unk>
That's reality today and in the future it's going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then just two little <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the newborn egg and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminate diabetes, to remove the <unk> to reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then that same engine is that same engine of science that can produce the changes for preventing diseases is going to allow us to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could do it with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we want to make the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that would normally take 100,000 years and we can take it to 1,000 years, and maybe it was happening within the next 100 years.
These are choices that your grandchildren, or grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these choices in a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or, we're going to try different attributes that we want for some of us, but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is boring and more boring or more robust, and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deeper of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to take these <unk> decisions.
For a good or for worse, and before what you might do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big blast when you're at <unk> feet tall.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a single seat that day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk about <unk> <unk>
So I immediately looked at it, and they said, "There is no problem. We probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had taken off the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could look at Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot took off the plane with the Hudson River.
Often that's not the road.
<unk> the engines.
Imagine being on an airplane and no <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three words you have ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the flight.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to come in, and I didn't do, all the fences that I wanted to <unk> all the experiences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that further, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'll put it up.
I don't want to marry nothing in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as we <unk> the George Washington bridge that wasn't much -- I thought about, wow, I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes have tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity it also gave me a place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I think about things that I didn't care care about.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as I did that, I decided to remove the negative energy from my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have a reason -- it's going to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how you watch your mental clock is going on <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please get <unk>
I don't want this to stand up in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, wow, I will die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for it all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to myself, "I love my life.
And that sadness <unk> in a single thought, which is, just desire one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- the first grade -- not a lot of artistic talent --  And I scream, <unk> as a little boy.
And to me, that was the whole reason of being the world.
And at that point I understood by connecting those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is a good father.
He was awarded a miracle, not to die that day.
And they gave me another gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and go back and live differently.
You who are flying today, the challenge you can imagine that the same thing happens in your airplane -- and please don't be -- but you imagine, and how do you <unk>
What is it that <unk> they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would their relations and negative energy on them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents that are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the great thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came to her home after he was running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today we have total paralysis has absolutely nothing.
You can only use your eyes.
His work on me.
I have a design design and animation design that, obviously, graffiti is something intricate that we admire and <unk> in the art world.
So we decided we were going to take them to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met her brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with it, and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "Wait a second, not that you see Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be somebody important and you have a good insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not accessible to people."
And I said, "Well, how did they communicate then?"
Somebody to see the movie "The <unk> and <unk>
They communicate that way, and they go <unk> with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented me with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I went to <unk>
I met her brother and her father there at that very moment, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony goes to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make her art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much inside of your inner can't afford it.
So I talked to a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research who has a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer of that and record the negative space.
So they go around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
First of all, you start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, after the Bush attacks, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in his <unk>
And so the journey began.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot to move the things on one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we played the gates of the insurance companies, and we get a machine that would be able to give up a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "I don't know. This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was bringing seven programmers from all the <unk> world from every single corner of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the children, and I moved into the garage and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> they took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and when they had been removed would have been removed from the walls and their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks, I was able to go in the shipping show of <unk> my son was part of my son too, and we created this.
It's called <unk>
They are a pair of glasses of the cheap sun that we buy in the Indian journey of <unk> Beach, some wire wire and <unk> and Radio <unk>
We took a camera <unk> the <unk> we put it on an LED light, and there's now a device that is free -- -- and it's built one way, we published the code for the software -- the software goes down for free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company.
There is no hospital that can tell you.
Any person with paralysis has access to draw and communicate using only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we came back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of programming in the night, Tony came back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the hospital parking parking lot.
And he came back to drawing for the first time in front of her family and friends -- and you can imagine what the feeling was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust into the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what was like, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody finally came to <unk> and they would get me out of there so I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a leatherback <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserve much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to do it, and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained many awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money on this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were <unk> "Oh, this is great!"
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up from closing the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of the Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of <unk> urban art, <unk> <unk> -- they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be in the show, which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: If you see something that is not possible, do it happen.
None of the stuff in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer -- the microphone, the <unk> -- nothing was possible at a certain moment.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not programmer, I never did anything with <unk> technology -- I just recognized something and I was excited about wonderful people in order to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want you all to do every day when we find ourselves with something that we feel like to do. If it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, whom is I do?"
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time as dangerous as a little bit of time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
Film care are difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days to eat just -- funny to the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous to the end.
In fact, in large part of my career I've been <unk> in situations as awful as the only goal of trying to examine social issues in ways that we are interesting attractive, and, hopefully we measure them in a way that they can be bothered and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I would come here to make a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you can have heard of it, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered to sell the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I was like, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it's all about and according to content could <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridicule you or your company to do it.
But this is a very good opportunity to do that.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I couldn't have been able to do it with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world of marketing, <unk>
And as I said before, I became horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be <unk> for something so difficult or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> So I want to do a film that is about the product of products, marketing and advertising, and that the whole film would come together with <unk> products, marketing and advertising.
The film is going to call "The biggest movie ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest movie ever <unk> is that all of the top at the bottom, it has a brand, and all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title -- the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
These people <unk> the film to the film forever.
And so the film explores all this idea, <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk>
I am a <unk> <unk> <unk> Just <unk> it was more by <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the X <unk> in the title but we're going to make sure that we were <unk> all the categories that we could in the film.
Maybe a shoe -- a shoe becomes the most cool shoe you've ever met.
The most cool car you've driven in "The largest film ever <unk> the best drink of <unk> from "The largest movie ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then to show the brands as part of life, make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and we actually show the full process of how it works.
The goal of the film is the transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the whole idea, all the shot of beginning to end.
And I would love to be <unk> to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- is the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> people are going to be people.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're going to look at it -- it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> -- David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: One million and a half and a half million -- John <unk> -- John <unk> I think it's going to be hard for the meeting, but it's definitely worth convincing a couple of big brands.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the time that we go out the film is going to look at us as a lot of <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the response?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers are going to be.
MS: But it will be difficult to deal with the film or to be I?
JK: Two things.
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people that you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where you go. <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation out of the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all of these companies disappeared.
None of you wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to present the product to so many people as possible, to make as many people as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of all separate media, not the idea to tell with that new vehicle that's worthy of attention to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had an error <unk> and that mistake was this one.
Actually no, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>    -- this is one of the first images that were introduced.
I like your way of <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> free simulation or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in the <unk> practices.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president -- the <unk> even <unk> <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it a whole thing that changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk>  -- like that weird bear that is still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird <unk>
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
We had a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to business and tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to <unk> <unk> history.
We want you to take a story, but that <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father stood up in a lie -- and there is him as I used to look at me, like, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and it's the <unk> story.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go on my mind, I would have to take a proxy for businesses and go to business myself with my team.
So what I started to figure out suddenly -- and I started giving me <unk> is that when you start talking to the businesses the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, enormous, giant giants and others who make small, independent movies like mine.
And my friends who make movies of big <unk> <unk> say the reason their movies have so much success is because of the brands they have.
And then my friends who make film films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, movies <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest movie ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say "Are you cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little bit nervous.
I want to help you with you.
Maybe you should get you a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there's one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as a solid, <unk> to <unk> on bar, whatever.
That's the general picture.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a glimpse of <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
They put into the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> are rather a <unk>
So we don't have the budget to have other brands.
So doing things like that, you know, remind you to remind people is the reason why we're interested in.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a big question.
Volunteer: tech.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something new, cool.
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and <unk>
It keeps you cool.
How do you keep you fresh, more time? With better <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those of the <unk>
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common guy.
I need to talk to the man of the street, people like me, to the ordinary <unk>
They have to talk about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: My <unk>
I don't know.
I like the good clothing.
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style that I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of the dark color, a lot of gray colors, and things like that.
Usually I'm wearing it as an sunglasses, or I like the <unk> or the <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: <unk> <unk> in part of <unk> <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the guy on the pets.
<unk> toys in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx out of the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can make it mark, but I often hit myself at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If they were able to do it for them, you could probably do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a familiar picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way of being.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world -- I think your world is the world that we <unk> like the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from and start in a place and in my case, and you start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: what's the next thing you want to talk?
MS: The next day is "This was the best day of my life."
A: how does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like I want to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird things, I like weird stuff.
A: Tell me about the <unk> to what makes us that?
What's the <unk> What is the <unk>
Why is it important to <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's a little bit more about you, which is not who you are.
How many other <unk> have you <unk>
You know, there's no fear. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience, <unk> Big <unk> Yes.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness to all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides but <unk> on your personality of <unk> the Morgan Morgan <unk>
They were very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox of them.
And I think a few companies just <unk> in one of their strong strengths or the other rather than focus on both.
A lot of companies tend to be able to avoid the things that are not <unk> and they avoid fear, those items, and you actually give them <unk> and you make something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> and brands -- those things that have gone and come and come and come up with a <unk> brand is a pretty powerful thing.
MS: A <unk> What's your <unk>
If somebody asks you to raise your identity of brand, your personality of brand, what would that be?
You're a <unk> attribute that you are somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you rather a <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> attributes are like being playful to be cool like <unk> contemporary -- <unk> bold or bold as <unk> <unk> quickly or <unk> <unk> dominant or mystic -- like <unk>
Or are you rather than <unk>
Are you conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
Are you <unk> traditional, <unk> <unk> <unk> you with <unk>
You're <unk> stable, familiar, safe, sacred, <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this movie we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who were saying <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how you now use MRI MRI to identify the centers of the desire in the brain so much for commercial marketing centers.
We went to St. Paulo where advertising advertising has been forbidden in the air.
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are getting their way into the schools with problems of money in the United States.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects that I have had the biggest answer or the ones that I've been most successful is those in which I interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They took off the <unk> they took off their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies have no interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think about people, who is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how did he gone? Did it succeed?
Well, since the film was sent into the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was sent back in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million in the media for this film.
This covers just a period of two and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not <unk>
It hasn't even been presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has begun to win momentum.
And it's not bad, because almost all the agencies we talk about is giving their customers not to be part.
I've always believed that if you take yourself out, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get out of the people that are pushing the failure.
I think when you train your employees in loss <unk> at risk is preparing their entire company for <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, let's move forward, I think we have to give it to the fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we need to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
Now more than a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk -- the <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data for companies around the world.
<unk> shows <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So we put it on the name of transparency, that happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check at the name of the clinical organization of TED, the Foundation Foundation -- a check, for <unk> to be applied to my attendance for TED next year.
The idea behind the <unk> computer <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
His greatest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant of <unk> in <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are real-time control systems.
If we can compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes are not using <unk> software -- they're a completely different technology.
But if we can put a cash virus out of Windows in a laptop that used for an engineer to set up this gray, <unk> then we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with an Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray, <unk> <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started researching <unk> about six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that you knew is that it's very, very complex at the part of <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed like wanting to do something with these boxes, these <unk> systems.
And that really struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we were looking at our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So they had really weird things.
<unk> <unk> like a laboratory rat who didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after experiencing different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking for active box in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect it's actually working on that location.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that's what I call my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because I said, "We don't know what's the <unk>
It might be, let's say for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the code code, and we found that I was <unk> on two <unk> bombs a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very <unk> by people who obviously had all the internal information.
You get all the dots to attack.
You probably even know how much <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> it's complex and high technology, let me tell you the payload is very complex.
It's very above all we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about about 15 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like old language.
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking for at the beginning were called the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and tried to deal with the real world, with potential goals of the real world.
We need theories about allowing us to pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals -- remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> valuable, and it's probably in Iran, because most of the infections has been <unk>
They don't find many thousands of targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all experts in <unk> and energy plants between our <unk>
I called them and I consulted them in an effort to <unk> his experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that part of the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> you certainly can <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to make nest <unk> so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
And we tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and its structures.
So for example, number <unk> shows up in that code, you can't get <unk>
I started to research scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we find in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence to understand what we had in the hands.
For not <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been away after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> on dead ends.
Still, we discovered that both digital <unk> would tell one and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we are very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about the other goals being <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw, I really showed me.
There's the gray box and the top box -- you see the <unk>
What this thing does is to intercept the input of input from sensors for example, of the pressure sensors and the vibration sensors and provide code code, which is still running during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these fake entry data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the safety camera feeds on <unk>
This is great yeah?
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> to the operators in the fourth of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the large steam turbine goes on speed, you have to open feedback valves in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't do that a human operator, right?
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can pass bad things.
The plant can explode.
And neither the <unk> or the security system is <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is really important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> with <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a energy plant, or in a car plant.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a key key -- like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms to <unk>
It would be as much as possible.
And if you made that, with what <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with lots of targets.
We need to face the implications, and we are better at getting to do now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been done in a lot of sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, so you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower here.
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, otherwise our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take you and give you a <unk> skills, or another thing to make wheelchair users up and go back and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
It's nothing different than something that gets in the morning, gives you a big force that will also increase its speed, and it helps him for example, to manage the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connected it with the universe and with other things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take a <unk> <unk> of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to get even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications and in the back, at 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage to the back.
We decided to look at this challenge, and create a exoskeleton that could help drive the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Universal Human History.
Soldier: With the <unk> exoskeleton I can spend 90 pounds through variables for a lot of hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner, to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the users of wheelchair chairs about what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people roughly, in the wheels of wheels around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a very conservative.
We talk about something that happens with often very young people, with damage in the spinal column that when their life -- to the 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be its only option.
We also talk about the population that <unk> <unk> very quickly.
Their only option, a lot of times -- a brain injury, or something else -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, since its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start to write a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago in the spinal column, and as a result couldn't go back to walk for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> <unk>
It has about sensors ...
It completely didn't fit in the crutches and they send signals to the computer computers here on the back.
There's also a few batteries that give the motors to the <unk> and on the knees, and they do it with this soft, very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years on the top of my life when, by a strange jump in the air, on the bottom of it was <unk>
In a fraction of the second, I lost all of feeling and all of it all the way down <unk> down.
Shortly after that, a doctor went into my room in the hospital, and he said to me, <unk> will never come back to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole to the last few hope of hope of my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs in <unk> and even riding rocks and even riding a <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talking to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just soldiers, but Amanda, and all the users of chairs from wheels to everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have the <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival. Man or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know how cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos in the rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their closest familiar relatives ...
That means that we all share a common ancestor, a evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made a lot of emphasis on this aspect of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large, <unk> the society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where the deadly violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of big apes.
They live in the depths of the forest -- and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> an extraordinary land of biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that's been since decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also put in danger the survival of the Bonobo.
The fear of meat and deforestation make it that you can't fill in a stadium with the bonobos who are in the world -- and, honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear the laugh, hidden the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know it as the ape <unk> love, not <unk> because they have <unk> sex and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> as humans, love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
For us and for them the game is critical to set up links and encourage <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the touch Bonobo you see the roots you see the roots of the laughter, the dance and the human simplicity.
The game is the glue that we get together.
I don't know how to play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First of all, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I'm not talking about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what it is doing.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, <unk> <unk>
I just believe that in this case, he loves it, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common as much as Bonobos in humans.
And this video is really interesting because this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements to the game, like <unk> and also how the game requires trust, and <unk> the <unk> and at the same time it's the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> perhaps the place where wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with <unk> water.
I think, like that, sometimes we play by ourselves, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world more and more difficult and more cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt with success to a world that changes we have to play.
But <unk> the most of our ability to play.
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
To bonobo and humans, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems the least appropriate to play, they can be the moments that it's the most <unk>
So <unk> primates, we will embrace this gift of evolution and play together as they fill creativity, the friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, we have fires a <unk> a <unk> a body of <unk> volunteers.
And in our city, where the volunteers are introduced to a highly qualified staff -- you have to get to the site of the fire very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of go.
But there was still a race to stand up against the other volunteers to get to the captain and figure out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that has certainly gone through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer I had just arrived before I am, <unk> <unk> <unk>  came first to the captain and he asked her to go in and save the dog <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or <unk> of money who, during the rest of her life, would have to tell the people who entered a burning building to save a living alive just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, "I need to get the home.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and bring this woman, a couple of shoes."
I promise it.
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got up the stairs, at the end of the hall, went to the fire firemen -- which is at the end of the <unk> and he went to the fourth main person and went to the fourth main shoes for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my load back through the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog on the front door.
I read from the home home for the owner of home where, as you would expect, her trove got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department got a letter from the owner of the house <unk> for the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at about what else was that someone had reached even a pair of shoes.
Both of my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as a voluntary fireman I'm witness by the acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of grace acts and courage to individual level.
And you know what I have learned?
It all has its importance.
So when I look in this room to people who have succeeded, or are for <unk> levels of success I'd like to remind you this:
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give you a little bit about it.
We had food in a <unk> <unk> a neighborhood park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save the life of someone but each day we're going to be able to influence someone.
So you trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks are built in <unk> with a very simple idea, modules of a fixed measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, in 1947, we came up with this.
He called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's estimated that they've made over 400 billion or 75 bricks for every person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges or buildings or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the block of concrete, the favorite in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, at the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> piled on some other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the block of concrete, the transistor allows to create much bigger circuits and more complex, a brick at once.
But there's a difference. The transistor was just to experts.
I personally don't think that the building blocks of our time are being reserved at the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of taking the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they come together with magnets.
So you can't put it wrong.
The bricks have a color code.
The green is the <unk> the <unk> the rose is the input and the orange of the orange is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue one with green and very quickly -- you can begin to make higher circuits.
A blue one with one green make light.
We can put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a pulse, which is here, and now we have a light <unk>
We put this <unk> to create more impact, and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple <unk>
In order to make it faster or slower or slower -- just this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a collection growing.
We want all of the interactions in the world to go into brick to use ready to use.
<unk> sound, solar panels, <unk> <unk>
We've given <unk> to children to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best is how they start understanding the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a night light, or why the door of an elevator lift it open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We also have led to design schools.
So for example, designers without any experience of electronics start playing with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>  A few weeks ago, we took the designers of the Rhode Island School of Rhode Island, who have no experience in engineering, just within cardboard, and paper, and we said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that has done a <unk> Canyon, moving around.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> <unk> which is afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, the electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be at all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, you can download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world is us.
So let's go ahead and make things.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is to get involved with the environment focusing on the environment.
It's distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I have the time to me.
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything we're supposed to do, we asked them to work on government.
The initiative called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> Peace <unk>
<unk> some members every year and put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of sending them up to Third World we send them into wildlife <unk>
They did great <unk> they worked with employees with them.
Their task is to show the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> <unk>
It's a hydrant in the city of Boston.
So here's as if I would find a quote, but what it really looks for is someone to have trouble when you get caught up through the snow because it knows it's not very good by turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for help in this very <unk> way?
Last year in Boston, we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment, we were very much last year.
They realized that the city would never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something else that citizens had <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice app where you can take a <unk>
You embrace <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case you put him <unk>
If you don't do that, someone can <unk>
So it has a component of the playground.
It's a modest application.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications that last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it extends <unk>
It's a responsible for <unk> city systems, to see this app that he could use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to make <unk> <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people steals the batteries.
That's why you ask citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that we use using it.
And this has been spread without <unk> organic and natural ways.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you will know that this doesn't happen either.
The acquisition of software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that they had done by the normal channels I would have taken at least two and cost about two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the power of California that until the time is two billion dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this on every level of government.
So an app that shows up in a couple of days, and it spreads in viral form is a kind of warning for the institution of government.
It suggests the best ways to work, not as in private companies like a lot of people think that should be.
It's not as a technological company, but more like the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has new <unk> not as a problem of an institution, but as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out that we are very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that they were building together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people in the entire country that contribute with applications of everyday applications, every day in their own communities.
They have not given up with the government.
They feel a lot of frustration that they have to do, but they don't get rid of it.
And these people know something that we've lost in sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that put us crazy -- the government is, essentially, in the words of Tim <unk> what we do together because we don't know.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
The politics doesn't <unk> the government.
And because the government ultimately <unk> out of us -- remember that of <unk> the <unk> -- the way that it thought about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started doing this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to be able to fix them.
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is about everything, a matter of <unk>
This is the center of information and information.
It is the place that serves the calls if you make <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this phone call.
He entered the basis of official knowledge.
He did nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put music well and see if you were <unk>
And it worked. So, because of Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a <unk> web and mobile phone called <unk>
I didn't hear that application.
It was the work of very smart people in the Bureau of New York City <unk>
One day, this really comes up with this <unk> <unk> on my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I make it <unk>
<unk> dynamic is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, it saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I'd come to the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
He turned the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and <unk>
And it's also a great example of the government income to private volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of <unk>
I'm talking about a platform for people to get together and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
I connected to two people.
And it might have connected to the government services of being necessary, but your neighbor is a better alternative and cheapest alternative than the government services.
When a neighbor helps other people, <unk> the communities.
If we call the animal control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people get it, but they think one is the input of the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have they chosen a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government is going to create our values and solve our needs, but we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface layer of <unk>
And underneath there is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it is that <unk> what keeps that that we have that we funded as something that is operating on against that thing, and in consequence we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real work work.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
You've got them <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report for 325 people in response to the order of <unk> <unk> of <unk> about the financial reform project.
That's not political activism is a political activism.
And for those of us that we've focused to government, it's time to ask ourselves, what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see huge challenges that are going to have to face.
They really believe we will get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't do without the government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible for the root to root the rule of government so that it can be expanding <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so difficult to act <unk> you just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I am a greater generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up with the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to talk about, you're all going to talk about.
You can express your views in any channel at the same time and do it.
So when you face the government problem, they don't care much about making your voices.
They're using hands.
They bring the work to the work for programming applications that make applications better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> taking out <unk> dumping a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside.
We were always able to have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people doing it.
But these applications are as digital <unk> that we are not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government we pay for taxes and we get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't have the <unk>
So I want to ask everybody, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we'll also be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in the prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in communities in communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm going to be here at TED seeing and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are saying here have impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
So here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they teach themselves with feeling, they can have special meaning in them.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of law, my work.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional family home of a family <unk> dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard it was strong, it had power.
It was the last word in all of them in the family.
She <unk> a lot of <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery at Virginia about <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with slavery -- the way the world looked like.
She was tough but it was also <unk>
When I was small and looked at it, she was approaching me and I gave me a good hug.
I got so hard that I could barely breathe and then <unk> me.
One or two hours later, I would go back to <unk> I came up and said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I said no, I went back to me again and if I said yes, I was left in peace.
I had this human quality that would always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of the 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture your time and your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
And I thought it was a game.
And then I looked at it, and she <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, went through the room, took me out of my hand, and he said, "Come on, let's go.
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget it.
And he took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell <unk>
I said, "It's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> I don't <unk> I said, "Sure."
And then I sat down, and he said, "I want you to know I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I will never forget it.
Then he said, "Just want me to ask me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me is you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to convince you, that always <unk>
As I <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
And then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to do is you are always going to do the right thing, even though the right thing is it <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk>
And then finally he said, "The third thing I want you to do is you have never been <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in South Honeybees I have a older brother and a sister a younger year.
When I was 14 --  15, one day my brother came home with a six <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> took us to my sister and I came out for the forest.
We just just got to make the <unk> <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and was offered to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You know, you <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> You know, and you always do the same thing that we do.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's going on? It takes a <unk>
He broke me up with strength and <unk> "Oh, not to be that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I am 52 years old, and I can admit I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this is a <unk> I'm saying it for the power that the identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others who don't really make sense.
We can't get to do things that don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother was naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner for the <unk>
My uncles died of age-related disease?
And these were the things that, according to it, with <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
Today there are 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the highest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass incarceration, in my opinion, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor communities or black, you find so much <unk> so much despair.
One of three black men between 18 and 30 years is in jail or <unk>
In the urban <unk> all over the country, Los Angeles, Baltimore Washington, Washington, 50 to 60 percent of all young people are in jail or in parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that makes you much better if you're rich and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth is affecting the results.
And it seems to be very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger make us believe that these are not a problem.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work in some of the most curious.
In my state, as well as in other states, you care about rights whenever you have criminal <unk>
Now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has lost the right to vote.
And if we put it over the next 10 years, the level of rights loss will be as high as it was before it comes to the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where they were known to 13-year-old children die in prison.
We have in this country prison for children, without a chance to go out.
We're in a process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They took people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a sense, we have helped us think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for existing crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in the United States is defined by error.
Out of nine <unk> people have identified one who is innocent who is <unk> and liberated from death row.
A mistake, <unk> an innocent in every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would not be allowed to fly airplanes if every nine you could have to be <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue if we deserve to kill.
And it's interesting that in my classes with students on <unk> I tell you about slavery.
I'm talking about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted to World War II.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a little defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about it.
The terror threat was what defined his lives.
Now there are older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teach talks, makes you <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our history to deal with the <unk> after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of racial and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All the time we do it for each other.
We continuously create tensions and conflict.
We work hard to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people were understood that we couldn't overcome the <unk> without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving lectures on death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation, and he said, "You know it's well disturbing to listen to what you want.
<unk> "We have no death penalty in Germany.
We will never be here."
The room was stuck in silence and a lady said, "There is no way that we have our history, we can ever get to get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational to us, and <unk> and <unk> we could put people together.
So let's talk about this.
How would we feel about a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you don't really care about these issues, the positive things and wonderful things they are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by the suffering, the abuse, the <unk> the <unk>
In my mind, you need to integrate both of them.
We talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more commitment, most of the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking about and talking about the poor, the ones that never come to TED.
And thinking about them is, in a way, something that's within our being.
We have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
We are in spite of being so rational, so rational, with the intellectual <unk>
It comes with innovation, the development is not just the brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also by the convictions of the heart.
This connection of mind with the heart is what drives us not just the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the difficult thing.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, <unk> for spirit, a will for being in despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I believe, that even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There is no disconnect that related to technology and design, that allowed us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to argue that these thoughts make a much more complicated identity than if we know these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were gathered just to talk about.
Occasionally, Mrs. <unk> I called me to go, <unk> come Mrs. <unk> We're going to get together to speak.
You want to come and take it away.
I said, "Be lady. I know I do."
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when I <unk>
I read <unk> <unk>
So I was going to go and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks went to me, and he said, "Now, let me tell me this idea of justice justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed to help them.
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice.
We try to end the sentences of life, without freedom for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce population in prison.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech and I would end up and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> completely <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> <unk> me on the face and said, "It's why you have to be very much but very <unk>
I think the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to figure out how to address those challenges, those issues, that suffering.
Because finally, humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
And I have come to understand and believe that each of us is higher to the worst that we have ever met.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody says a lie, not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if anyone takes something that doesn't <unk> it is not a <unk>
But even if someone kills the other, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people who should be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's not.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that although it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge our technology, because of our design and rational.
At the end of a society, not by the way they deal with the rich, powerful and <unk> but because of the way they treat the poor, they prescribe the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound themes about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients of 13 and 14 years old, which have been <unk> to be told as adults.
And I start to think, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to someone who isn't it?
The judge <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
One night too afternoon was wake up <unk> God, if the judge can become something that you're not, you must have magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magic powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> <unk> a <unk> black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my <unk> black customer is treated like a privileged party of <unk> executive from a <unk>
In the <unk> I put there that there had been <unk> behavior in the <unk> of the police and the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had <unk> it was sent to the court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to the cut for this case stupid.
I got into the car and I was really excited about it.
I went in the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got out of the car. I walked down to court.
I was going up the stairs when I met with a black man, <unk> was the <unk> of the courthouse.
When he looked at me, he came up to me and said, "Who you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you <unk>
And then I approached myself and <unk>
And I was <unk> in the ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
By coming in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> And we started myself.
People started to go. Everybody was <unk>
I was that I had written those <unk>
Did the policemen have the prosecutors like the <unk>
So suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people. Everybody furious because we talk about races, because we were talking about inequality.
With the eye of the eye, I reached the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I looked down the window, and he would invite you to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and for there.
And finally, this old black black was sitting in the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge would have a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> he showed him upset because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> ran over the old black black.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk>
And the old black stood up, looked at me and he looked at me and said, <unk> this audience room to tell this young woman to keep her sight in the goal with <unk>
I have come today to TED, because I think many of you understand that the moral bow of the universe is very large, but it folds towards justice.
We cannot be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and our dignity.
That our survival is tied to each other.
That our visions of technology, and entertainment and creativity must lead to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, all of the people here who share this, I just want to tell you that keep your sight in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, of this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities close to it.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which is going to make an effort to fund the funds that are spending today in policy policy.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row, in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the homicide cases, not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> don't get at all.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to make the law of the law, to safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it's said it has to do with the biggest rate of <unk>
What would you say to the ones that you think is this?
<unk> Actually, the incarceration rate has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong war.
That's why this increased dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people into the supply chain, for stealing a bicycle, for small crimes against the property, rather than making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have you really excited about this today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh my God.
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months -- <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media means <unk> negative news, because our minds are paying attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
Every second one day our senses are receiving a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters more to survive, the first stop of all of this data is an ancient clip of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector -- the <unk>
<unk> and records all of the information is looking for something in the environment that could make us.
So of course, from a <unk> stories to look at the negative.
That old adage of <unk> "If there's blood, you know, it's very true.
And because all of the digital devices give us negative news, the seven days of a week, 24 hours a day, no wonder we're <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be wrong.
But maybe it doesn't.
Maybe, instead what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the enormous progress that has done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the water extinction -- water shortage, and we have no doubts we have.
As human beings, we are very good at <unk> the problems and the long one, we just had them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> the average income per capita will have been <unk> in the whole world.
Child mortality has shrunk 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of electricity and transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy passed 25 to over 80 to over 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We are really living a remarkable time.
A lot of people are <unk>
And we continue to grow more and higher and higher expectations again.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the line of poverty has electricity, water, toilets, refrigerators television, phones, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> on the planet would never have dreamed of <unk>
So much of this is the technology and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we <unk> on information technology jumps over this curve, Moore's Law -- and doubling the performance of the price for about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to watch two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, in recession, in depression and <unk>
It's the result of fast computers that are used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop any of the great challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in a law on the left, it goes up.
The growth rate of technology is increasingly faster.
And on this curve, to Moore's Law -- there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
<unk> computation in the cloud, my friends of <unk> call infinite computing computing, sensors and networks, the 3D printing and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet, the synthetic biology, the fuels and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw victory on "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was darkness.
I went back in the newspapers the best headline to <unk>
And I loved this one: <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not a easy game.
He plays with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all in your phone.
Four years ago, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or a service that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a bunch of companies that have been done.
When I think about creating plenty, doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each of the planet, it is about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that which is poor and making it <unk>
You see, <unk> is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
It's a story about Napoleon <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
The troops ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet, was worth more than the gold and the <unk>
That's why the tip of the Washington Washington is aluminum.
You see, even though the aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth, it doesn't come like pure metal.
It's tethered to oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made the aluminum thing so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
We put this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy supply.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that's about 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk> minutes.
It's not about lean but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the generated <unk> <unk> versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, electricity will cost six cents an hour per hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan wrote the Voyager space to the Earth, in 1990, in 1990, <unk>
It was a famous picture. How do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent per water.
Yes, <unk> water is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of water on the planet, but also there is an hope.
It's a technology that's available not 10 to 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is the size of a small fridge size.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any <unk> saltwater, water, contaminated water -- for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just thought it will make a significant test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that it will be, Coca-Cola is going to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an extraordinary innovation for this technology that is today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the end of 2013.
<unk> that Lakota warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And from having a smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one could have predicted this.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video, images, libraries of books and music technology -- <unk> now <unk> and they lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing comes up when you get the application for health.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the Foundation, and something called the X Prize, <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the world teams so that these technologies are in a mobile device with which they talk, and because it has <unk> you can get blood from your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where you have no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent of the health care workers.
When this <unk> device a virus of RNA or DNA that we don't mean to call the health of health and, first of all, they will prevent the pandemic.
But this is the greatest force to produce a world of plenty.
I call it the billion <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just passed the fifth billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll go from two billion to five billion users on the Internet.
Three billion minds never before you think about the global conversation.
What would these people?
What do you do? What <unk> <unk>
And instead of an economic collapse we will have the greatest economic injection in history.
These people represent tens of billion dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education of the Academy of Khan and because of using 3D impressions and the computer in the cloud it will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us three billion more of humanity, healthy polite and <unk>
How about some voices never before <unk>
What if we give the oppressed, wherever we give the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard, and we could act for the first time?
What do you do? These three billion?
And if they are contributions we can't <unk>
One thing I learned with the X Prize, is that small teams guided by his passion with a clear goal of course, can do things -- things that were previously able to make big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you heard of.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and the functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
Have you played with this university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined and started <unk>
And it's shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me enormous confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the actual passion of <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are going to take us to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few decades in front of decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
The <unk> of the point of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it didn't.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is at the Red <unk> Red <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The <unk> they still say they follow <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept: which is shifting the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a water in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition <unk>
The water was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, of <unk>
There was <unk> from about 20 inch, a black beard, <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so he was earning more of the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had gone down in half.
I went to the <unk>
<unk> a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is I was complicit in the introduction of fishing fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s, <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
<unk> development was imposing the countries that had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty bad boat, called the <unk> four.
I went to fish in it, and we did studies in southern China Sea and especially in the Beaufort Sea.
What we capture was something <unk>
You know, I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are on the bottom.
And most of the fish are blobs of tiny <unk> that are different from coral reef fish.
In short, the sea bottom came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then it starts commercial fishing down.
The bottom of being a solid coral of being soft coral in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
I don't <unk> them because they were dead.
Once we capture a alive.
I was still not <unk>
And so they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collect every time they go to an area where they have never fish.
But there's no <unk>
We don't remember the world, but we don't remember it.
We will take the starting point, a new level, not to remember what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have weird things -- biodiversity, number of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use images to be able to use the images in the beginning of their conscious life as normal and extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive the loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the accumulation of changes.
And at the end of the end, we got some <unk> remains.
And that, in large measure, we want to do now.
We want to keep things that are no longer they are, or not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when minority societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose <unk> animals.
You lose animals.
Even if this doesn't perceive it as a huge loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a synonymous sea of big fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
And over time, there are few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because evidence presented in a way before they are not in the way they would expect to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of the <unk> as I was willing to learn about that and maybe looked at a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or, generally they don't use the scientists of <unk> because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, although we lived in <unk> societies because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
Out of the enormous role that can make a protected marine area.
Because with the marine marine areas, we actually recreated the past.
So let's give you the past that people cannot conceive of because the starting point has run and extremely low.
That's for the people who can see a marine protected area, and they can benefit from the vision that they <unk> which allows them to erase their point of <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like people in the West West, for example?
I think there is the arts and cinema maybe can fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the <unk> Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the harbor bay 500 years ago.
And you might have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> talking about the story of <unk> why do they <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a certain sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is Cameron <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> manager of <unk> and I look at YouTube YouTube video.
It's true.
So today, we will see why the videos are making viral and how important it has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed something very, very difficult.
But today the web video makes any of us, or of our actions, copper in a part of our global culture.
Anyone can be done famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They rise over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of those, just a small percentage gets a small percentage of them gets infinite of visits and makes a lot of cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: Three things: communities of participation communities and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
KT: Oh, my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot outside his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the views on the rise of last summer.
<unk> you don't want to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were a lot of videos from nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this thing that I used to put in the video to the popularity video.
The trends of trends like Jimmy <unk> we have new things and interesting things to a wider audience.
Rebecca
<unk>
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency rate.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come out of nothing.
So what did this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> it's also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, I took a <unk> and a lot of blogs started writing about this.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to do a joke on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of makers will embrace a point of view, and they share it with a larger public accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this big internal joke then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the 20th century, the 20th century of the 20th century, this community participation is our way of being part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation animation with a <unk> music.
So that's it.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there's a three million hours that has been seen four million times.
Even cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But what's important here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet community.
There was <unk>
Somebody did a version of the old version.
And then it became international made.
Suddenly it came up with a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a silly joke to something that we all can form around.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Uncle <unk> or <unk> <unk>
What would this script might have been writing that <unk> this situation?"
In a world in which two days of video got up two days of video is just going up for a minute, only that was only unexpected and unexpected can be solved by the way these things have done.
When a friend said to me that I had to see this great clip of a guy who <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit I didn't really interested in too interested in much.
Casey <unk> I am <unk> by the <unk> but often there are obstacles that keep you properly stopped by <unk>
KA: Thank you a surprise and her humor, Casey Casey <unk> I found that five million watched and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth all the new things that we make in creative ways.
And all of this leads us to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> communities, creative communities for participation, the totally unexpected, are features of a new media -- a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the popularity of it.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
They didn't get permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owners own our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- it's barely the current means of the current means -- but they will take the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique hopes of unity and freedom of his country.
<unk> as <unk> enter the fact that their life had been totally on vain.
The words, for so much time, friends, now <unk>
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken by the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old, when her father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girls.
For her, life had been destined for a task -- the escape of her family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do that.
And after a <unk> <unk> which is challenges -- a boat slid into the sea dressed in the sea dressed in <unk> ship.
Every adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear of business, the rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> with poison.
If we were <unk> we would take my sister and I, and then she and grandmother.
My first memories are about that boat, the constant rate of the motor, the <unk> diving into every wave, and the vast and empty horizon and gap.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but that they were <unk> with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to break for six hours.
But I can remember the lights of the oil platform front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man that collapsed and died, to end the journey was too much for it, and the first apple that I did -- given by the men on the platform.
None apple had then the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations to shape a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> of <unk> whose population is comprised of immigrant <unk>
Unlike the middle class <unk> whose existence was <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English <unk> <unk> between people who had one thing in common: They were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a line of cars, working six days, <unk>
Still, I found time to study English and get a title of <unk> <unk> of <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and they established an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, they wouldn't mind what it was -- which was usually <unk> <unk> was always <unk>
Two pairs of half a school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform until the <unk> because he had to last six years.
And there was <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk>
At home, where?
Something in me <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were terrified of our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother's movement.
My mother had <unk> all the ship.
And my task was to be awake until their <unk> would start to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer shop, then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition, angry and <unk> and <unk> <unk> between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classical <unk> relentless student with what I was talking about myself.
In the other, I was <unk> in the other time, tragically tragically tragically threatened by violence, drug abuse and insulation.
But a lot of them got help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of 30, I chose the young Australian man.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges not <unk>
So <unk> a <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> was now so <unk> refugee and social activist who was invited to talk about sites that I had never heard of, and in houses she would never have imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat to the <unk> and the comfort of life in a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters end the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of every one and <unk> <unk> three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we climb the ship.
He had never been an option.
<unk> told me, "and you're not going to be what you don't know.
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly classes -- the more it was <unk> to talk.
I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what they were living in living on the border of the possible.
And although I finished my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk> career.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be an unknown -- a newly new leap in the scene -- and not only it's good, but it's something that will be grateful, but it's a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean accepting the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world <unk> but not the way we fear the world.
They didn't have been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was an energy there, an aesthetic optimism -- a rare mixture of humility and <unk>
So I followed my intuition.
It would give a small group of people for the people who the slogan <unk> <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, he was doing a giant pot of soup that everybody <unk>
They went back to a while at night at night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but a few brilliant, and we opened it up.
I made the decision to move to the United States.
after a single journey.
My <unk>
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk>
Before I end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up at a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 it became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of her husband, caused an <unk> to the <unk> and take the cause she did, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
He can't make it proven to be wrong.
He was in the shower in a hotel room in <unk> when she died, <unk> <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around her <unk>
We tell the stories and make sure that we were still with it.
At night, a monk came and said it had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> her hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why her hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You don't have <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since the people who were and how life built us, we can now see that the men who had come to our lives would have gotten us in.
The defeat would have been very easily.
Now I want to have my own children, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could wish that to you?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy thing.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, and I can be brave in every wave, the <unk> <unk> rate -- the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see them safe, I would do.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of so is here in the fourth or fifth row.
My story begins in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the sky of the sky with the singer <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the old Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel to a car and drop the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when I was <unk> the great Arab warrior Indian warrior <unk> I was <unk> and he took a bow on the ground, he could see water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was really excited to me.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
And I was struck by this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed to me that the technology had to allow the magic, not <unk>
As a child, my grandfather gave me his pocket.
And this piece of technology of 50 years was to my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world filled with images, of pirates and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the sense that the mobile phones -- the luxury clocks and the luxury of luxury from the <unk>
Will our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I got to this technological world to see how to use to create magic, rather than <unk>
They took books from the age of 16,
So when I saw the iPad I saw a <unk> device able to connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we took the book.
Where we are.
We put the text with the image, the animation, sound and touch.
The narrative becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that do us?
I'm about to launch an interactive app for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I got a character from the book.
In many times I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- which is led to me.
My inner girl gets excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and <unk> but to that magic of childhood to those ideas that we use of children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always turned to me.
So here, we have to shift the iPad to release fireflies.
And really, you light up your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated with a little girl was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
And in all fantasy book, there's always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that goes off, <unk> and guides you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book it was also <unk>
So now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect for me is to create Indian content and the contemporary means.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their <unk> <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the camera cameras for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a <unk> child history.
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not out to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can bring our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that you have to go out outside the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a girl I had a lot of <unk> from <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason children don't do it.
So to recover this childhood ritual you have to go out and in a chapter, and you know, a picture of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So you create a digital collection of photos that then can put on the Web.
A picture of London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "We've seen a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the relationship of connection between magic, Earth and technology there are many possibilities.
In the next book, we have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and through augmented reality, you see a encouraged group that appear about the inner plants.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves in the screen.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and be able to read the rest of the book.
We go to a world where the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and technology to come up with one another.
<unk> the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and to that magic, joy and love that we sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a head of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What would you do?"
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of all, or maybe not all, but most of the <unk> projects, they fail because we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a doorknob and on a closed <unk>
Every morning I got stuck.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put my challenge to 95 percent.
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> it sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time as it needs assistance and some urgency of that style, but you see it backwards.
But there's something else.
Like some of you you know, I have more than four followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to me to my Wi-Fi scale and before I go up to my car, people start with <unk> -- I think you need an light.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure pressure in order to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients quit smoking.
On the other hand, it can <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together to develop some activity <unk> to have more control of their health.
From next week, it's going to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people <unk> from their houses, taking their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where the patients assume a position, they get back to regain control and being captains of their own <unk> but also it can help us health care because of the challenges that we face, like the firing of the costs of attention -- the demand for demand and other issues.
And I think of techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share with you with a video.
We all have checks in the <unk>
Maybe we even have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where <unk> ATMs in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the nearest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked no one of them.
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we made <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> for <unk> <unk> where, and when it's open, because they sometimes open up in <unk> <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 people were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an application for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time they are in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> you can use their iPhone, and the next weeks to use their cell phone for the next few years, to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I want to introduce this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to go globally.
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find and act as a center for the <unk> of <unk> all over the world.
Every time you're on holiday and somebody else can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I'd also like to invite companies around the world that could help us <unk> these <unk>
They could be <unk> or <unk> <unk> for instance, to see if the <unk> shown is still in their place.
Please focus on this and not only improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> <unk>
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, it's photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed with my previous passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because by using the camera the process was on the planning process.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when you push the <unk>
For me, photography had more to be in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by pressing the <unk>
So let's take it like this: a building on a very <unk> road.
But it has a unexpected.
And despite that, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful in time, but with the common objective of keeping the entire world level.
And when I say, "I mean <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that can be <unk> but I always want it to look like -- in some way as a photograph.
<unk> where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that does seem real <unk>
These are the details or the <unk>
So let me go light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But in the end, it's our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects, something that we all can relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some ways you can create something that still looks like <unk> as if I existed.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's move into the brain, because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It really involves combining different realities.
And the things that make a look as realistic I think they're those in which they don't even address the things around us in our everyday lives.
But when I combine a little bit of photographs, it's very important, because otherwise something will be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the photos you need to have the same kind of light.
And these two images do with these <unk> were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect signal.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is completely composed of photographs of different places.
In the staff, I think it's easier to create a place that you would find out because you don't need to put the ideas that has on your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter I knew I had several months to try and find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a rock.
And yes, I even made a red spot the house on the top of the island to look more <unk>
So in order to get an realistic outcome I think it's missing planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then we have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful, and at a very realistic time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
Please, if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anyone who took out of a mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details of the details but the general way.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, as many other things we tend to see, is a straight kind of line on scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the <unk> scale.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves that is new.
So here's something weird happens.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn the lights down.
It's more intensity because they write about paper.
Why do we bring technology to technology on <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw them in a regular curve where, say, these are the years or some time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to show you the diagram is something ridiculous.
That would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you will, for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of the transport is going as fast as <unk> tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There's no <unk> in the history of technological development of <unk> growth that every few years advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- looking at these curves -- we see that they don't go forever.
You can't sustain this rapid change as it goes.
So let's take one of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical <unk> I know like this until it comes something completely different, or maybe it will do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So we're going to be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what the world used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, what is that new way to adopt the world?
Why new state is the world?
The transition looks very, very confused if we're involved in it.
I remember a child in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
You can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it will all be so different that extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how that transition could be <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is to take distance and look at the long-term things.
The time scale that I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So you go back about two and a half billion years when the Earth was a huge <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals that were coming around them.
If you look at the way that those chemicals are organized we give us a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, it was floating out of oil oil with all kinds of chemical recipes in its inside.
Some of those oil drops was a particular combination of chemicals that made them bring the materials out of the outside and so the drops grew up grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms, those oil <unk>
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random recipe for chemicals.
And every time they <unk> it would be a distribution of chemical distribution of the chemicals that are <unk>
So each <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, the drops that somehow gets to be better at bringing the chemical <unk> more <unk> more chemicals and more <unk>
Mostly, they lived more time, they were more <unk>
It was a way of life, a very simple chemistry, but things become interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
Somehow we don't understand very well these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this sort of meaningless evolution -- a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to do for them.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, you have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for <unk> We can now write things with this code.
Here's 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide the security people.
But <unk> Tom this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and I would take it 10 to 22 times.
So if anyone wants to 100 million copies of my personal card, I have a lot of <unk> in fact, for every single person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and have it spread through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
And this made these cells happily be happy -- another billion years.
But then there was another interesting step in which things got very different -- and it was that these cells started exchanging and communicating information to forming information and cell communities.
I don't know if you know it, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, it evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found a way to avoid penicillin and <unk> them to create their little DNA with other bacteria, and now there's lots of resistant to penicillin now, because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place that they would form communities that, in some ways, they were together in it, and a <unk>
And so <unk> or <unk> together, whatever if a community was very successful all of the individuals in that community were getting older, and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point occurred when these communities were very approached by the fact that they actually came together and decided to write the whole recipe from the community together in a string of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities of <unk> communities, communities of many different cells working together like a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells who don't act alone.
The skin cell is not serves without the heart, or the muscles or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels than the cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
And these started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than process information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those mobile cell communities.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and convey information.
Those were brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as <unk> Learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So one organism can, for example, learn not to eat any fruit because he knew bad and got sick the last time she ate it.
That could happen during the life of a organism given that they had built these kinds of processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system has built those information structures -- accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, a really complicated idea in your head.
I'm here sitting here emitting <unk> and, hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in their heads that makes some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated that we turn it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start working as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've begun to perform <unk>
Now we go through similar periods of similar periods of organisms -- <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.
The <unk> computer <unk> the tape tape, <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where some evolution produced with the <unk> program before our eyes.
And now we've accelerated scales over time again.
The first stages of the story that I would tell you was taken a billion years each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, it took about hundreds of millions of years.
The rest of that language and so on, took less than a million years.
And next one, it seems to take just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the more you do it.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see that the process is <unk>
But I make a living, designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that jobs for <unk> wouldn't be possible without the recent happiness.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to become conventional <unk>
I don't know that every transistor in that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine, and the machine with that makes something that didn't do before, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes uses methods we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method, which I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instances of instructions to chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all those programs, and you take those things that we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to point numbers to put a simple example.
So we find the programs that are closer to tidying up numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, was able to find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that better did the <unk>
Let's get those out of the rest.
And now I get the things that best <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that we <unk> children, that <unk> <unk> and that the children will give up the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs of the combinations of the combinations of programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's go back again.
I had some mutations in it.
And it tries to go and try and try and try and get it to another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in a few minutes, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are doing absolutely perfect way.
In fact, they're very much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze it to see how they work.
They're dark programs.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I do know, I have the safety of the goal that the goal is because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that were able to do it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on doing this.
I once went in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he gets a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight, doesn't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make computer design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the choices that there is.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so that they can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, they <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems to be so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part to think that we are the end product of evolution.
And I think we all are part of the creation of whatever it comes from.
But now comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I <unk>
I think we need to do something with a part of the medical culture that should change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that is me.
And I've taken time enough to let me give up some of my fake <unk> on that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end of the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to be able to get out of the <unk> the <unk> talk about the statistics and to use them to form a lot of baseball.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know about it.
It's called the average of <unk>
And we're talking about 300 of a <unk> that we <unk> 300.
That means the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball off to the game field without being <unk> and that anyone who is <unk> to the first base, it doesn't come to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how they call a 300 percent <unk> in the Big <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk> <unk>
By the way, that's someone that 10 <unk> hit four.
<unk> like legendary Williams, the last Ted Williams, the last player of the League Mayor of <unk> in a regular basis.
Now I put this into my world of medicine where I feel so much more comfortable or perhaps less awkward, after what you tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, a surgeon who has also a record of 400 in <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a place and a wants to have two arteries <unk> <unk> and your family doctor comes to a cardiologist whose record is <unk>
But you know what?
She's getting a lot better.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'm going to tell you.
What do you think it must be the average of the hits of a heart surgeon, or a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, pretty good.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in the medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is send me to the world, and I include myself about the <unk> of being perfect.
I never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I was looking at when I was in medical school.
I was a 45-degree student.
Once, a mate in high school, said Brian Goldman
Such which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the foreign Hospital of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> diagnostic diagnosis and frequent <unk>
And I even knew the Swedish diagnosis of how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as they move more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> of medical school with the impression that if you did everything, then would know everything, or as possible, close to everything, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lady in the emergency service in the emergency room where I worked.
At that time, I was assigned to <unk>
And when I was asked to go to a cardiologist I was going to hit that patient.
and reporting the chief of residents.
When I saw the Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard sound <unk>
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both sides, which gives me heart heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops going to work and, instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to our lungs, these are <unk> and so you have difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I read about.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on your heart.
I gave him <unk> water, so that I could eliminate it.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> I sent her home.
In fact, I made two mistakes more.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get the phone nor did what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen, I would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
And maybe I didn't want to be a resident for constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and capable of taking care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
And when they sent her home, I didn't recognize a voice on my interior that was like, <unk> is not a good idea. I don't know.
In fact, I was so insecure that I asked the nurse to ask him, "Do "Do you believe it's okay if he goes to her <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said, <unk> I think I'm okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed the high school and ambulance together with the ambulance with her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad deal in our stomach.
But I kept my job.
At the end of the day, I was able to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot, where I was my car to go home. At that time, I did something I don't do normally, at the time.
It happened for the emergency room for home.
And there was another nurse, not the <unk> of the lady <unk> before, but another one, he told me three words, those three words that most emergency <unk>
Other specialists who fear too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see patients <unk>
The three words are: remember you?
He remembers the patient that sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was okay.
But I came back and at the edge of death.
At an hour of an hour of having gotten to her house, after I gave him the high, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> of the emergency room with a blood pressure of <unk> which means a shock severe.
I just barely breathe and I was blue.
The emergency staff is going to take all its resources.
They gave him medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk> artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> he was in intensive care and waiting against all hope that they <unk>
And in the two or three days it was clear that they never <unk>
He had permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was going to become what was going on.
And in ninth day, they let her go. Mrs. <unk> wife, and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks to me, and I experienced for the first time the shame shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt by alone, <unk> without feeling that shame shame because you can't do it with your colleagues.
You make peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> <unk> that I talk about is that makes us feel very bad on it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt it.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure you would take things out, and I made sure that I didn't get involved.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he sent her home?
And my worst <unk> Why made I made a mistake that <unk>
Why chose medicine?
Little to that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And on one day, he opened the sky and finally came out the sun and asked me if I felt better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if you were to make the efforts to be perfect to don't make more mistakes, it would take those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
It was going to happen.
Two years later, I was hit in the emergency department of a community hospital in the community hospital in Northern Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched her because I was a little bit <unk>
He sent him penicillin and sent him home.
But as he was heading to the door he was following his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my guard guard my head asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he made the three words: remember you?
Remember the patient who saw a pain in the <unk>
Well, he went back and didn't have a <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not because of the throat, but from the top, it's going top of that side of those tracks.
He, not died.
They were <unk> antibiotics and <unk> <unk> in the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then <unk> me and went back to work, until it happened over and over again, and over again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it was transferred to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought he had a calculus <unk>
I took an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out, a colleague who was checking to the patient -- some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner, and I called the surgeon to surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I made liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to read it.
I went through it and when I notice some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner, I called the surgeon to surgeon.
Both were operated operated and they recovered well.
But every single case I get excited to me.
But I'd like to tell you I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as a lot of colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful ones have been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and without support.
And here's the problem: If I can't clean myself and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> to tell me what's really going on, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I teach them this to not make the same <unk>
If I would go to a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course in a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues too, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg, believe it would have difficulty looking at your eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> which make mistakes and the ones that don't sleep, and the ones that you can't sleep, and the ones that you can't sleep with the results and the ones that have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you ask about medicine to people who make mistakes.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I've made a personal study of poor medical litigation and failures to learn how to do that, from the first article that I wrote for the Toronto "Star <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where the mistakes are happening every day, where one in 10 drugs are happening in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where respiratory infections are increasingly <unk> and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they killed 24,000 <unk> by medical errors.
The U.S. Medical Institute has established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so these things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is added every two or three years, and we don't get involved.
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain -- comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath out of alcohol and all of a sudden, my story was <unk> from contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't get their symptoms always the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we <unk> and we eliminate all the professionals as opposed to error, well, not going to be anyone.
And with respect that people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white, Art <unk> is a habit to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from <unk> to the chief of surgery -- "This is my worst <unk> blah, blah, <unk> <unk> <unk> blah, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And his students were <unk> to come down and come down the head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
You can say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor.
Your physician <unk> is human, you know, they accept it, and it won't be proud of their mistakes, but it's trying to learn from what happened to teach others.
They put their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a loving and support way that everybody is <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they become errors in a time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I'm a human, making mistakes.
And I feel so much, but I am a lot of effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
You know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average number of choice that he says to pick an American American, are about 70 to a day.
Not long ago, in a research followed by a week to a group of CEOs of companies.
The researchers recorded the different <unk> tasks for these executives and the time that they were doing to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> was a week.
Naturally, every job included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of your time.
Now think of your choices.
Do you know how many of you belong to the <unk> of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How do you grade the way that those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the <unk> choice before we choices.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive, please give you a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
When I was a graduate student at Stanford University, I cofounded this supermarket at the very, very small level, at least in that time was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruit and vegetables and about 25 of the <unk> water, and this was when we were taking water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I could ask myself, why did I never buy nothing?
This is a shelf from the oil oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in <unk> who came from trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked her, <unk> this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed down the buses full of tourists who came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment. This is the <unk>
hall.
They had <unk>
I put a post in front of the shop.
We put it out of six <unk> or 24 flavors -- and we looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop trying to test the <unk>
More people stopped when I had <unk> a 60 that when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
So here we find the opposite effect.
The ones that stopped when I had <unk> only three percent got to buy <unk>
From the ones that stood up when there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six that if they were six.
Well, to decide that we don't buy <unk> probably we are <unk> less is good to preserve the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the performance of choices is affecting us <unk>
We decided to do not to decide, even when this is not <unk>
Right now, the financial savings issue.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we look at the best savings decisions for retirement with about a million Americans, from about a million Americans, from between 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in seeing whether the number of <unk> available for savings plans for retirement, the program <unk> <unk> people saving for the future.
And we found that there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the <unk> <unk> were less participation.
So if you look at the ends, we see that in the plans that they offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 percent or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that we offered about 60 funds, the rate of participation descended to the <unk> 40.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there is more options, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for the ones that they decided to participate, the more the number of options, the more people would be saved.
The more options, there were more options, they were more willing to invest in financial financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we have to optimize to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three main negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we <unk> the decision, even when it goes against the self-interest.
They are more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less <unk> although they objectively to get better.
The main reason is that we <unk> with looking at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations to visualize a contrast and choose of that awesome <unk>
Today I want to show you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so that you can test in your business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, that less is more.
People always care about when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in the <unk>
But what we're seeing is what we're seeing more and more is that if you choose to cut, get rid of strange options, get rid of strange options, and there's going to be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different kinds of <unk> & <unk> at 15, saw 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Golden corporation just eliminated the products to waste cats that are less likely to be lifted up in <unk> by two <unk> more sales and lower costs.
It's known that today's supermarket is 45,000 products.
In a store store it is about 100,000 products.
But the largest store in the world today is <unk> and it provides only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato tomato sauce.
In the world of financial savings I think one of the best examples that have come out of how to manage the best choice is David <unk> the Harvard.
All the Harvard employees are <unk> automatically to a insurance fund of life.
People who really want to choose, you give them 20 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They are all <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that there are between those choices.
And if their employees can't afford it, you can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking about <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer the people in this audience on a vacation with all paid paid at the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give a applause if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> Good. All right. Anybody who's ready to accept the deal.
They are not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something more.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really had to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first trial, that in the second -- but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images were making it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to manage the problem of the choices, which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of every option, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very concrete,
Why are people spending 15 percent more on average, when you use credit cards or credit cards that when you use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to do more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> who worked on <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
At that meeting that we were looking at exactly as a <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was that we asked the staff to think about the positive things that would be interested in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in <unk> 20 percent and increase in the number they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than choices.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine <unk>
We saw that in Route <unk> across the corridor of <unk> the photograph of magazines can contain from <unk> different kinds of until <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> Okay, there's a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the right is <unk> but you know something?
This <unk> framework is totally useless.
The categories must tell you something that they <unk> not when they <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge fundraising.
I know who they're <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out we can handle a lot more information than what we think, if we just put it a little bit.
We need to increase the gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a <unk> <unk> you buy a car.
This is a German German manufacturer of cars that lets it completely <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions to put up the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offer each one.
<unk> color from the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> <unk> box <unk>
What I'm going to do is vary the order of the order that the decisions come in.
So half of customers are going to go from a lot of choices, 56 colors, just about four <unk>
The other half customers are going to go in a few of customers -- four <unk> at 56 colors, lots of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How involved you are.
If you <unk> the default button in every decision, it indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that those who go from many choices to <unk> <unk> the default button over and over again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go in a few options a lot, keep there.
The same information, the same number of choices.
All I did was to alter the order where the information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although the pick box doesn't say nothing about the preferences of decoration.
We're excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> <unk> eliminate alternate alternatives to do it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories with less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've been presented with were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their business, or for people who work.
It's that I think the key to get the best of a choice is to be careful about <unk>
And the more careful we are in our choices we can do a choice of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the years of <unk> in East Germany, <unk> if you had a typewriter to write about the government.
I had to record a sheet of example written with the machine.
And this for the government to track the origin of texts.
If you were writing with the wrong message to track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that somebody could do this, how much of this is going to take the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer of any big manufacturer and it prints on a page, that page will end up having some yellow dots on every page that you follow a pattern that makes you own one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody looks very much like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
The <unk> cell phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberattacks to make a lot of money, a huge amount of amounts.
There are really many cases of <unk> online and <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthieu Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their <unk> online but they do it by illegal media through <unk> banking to steal the money from our accounts when we buy <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards, when we buy a computer computer.
The secret service of the U.S., two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this tells you about <unk> million dollars when it was frozen frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> they don't know her <unk>
And I say today is more likely than any of us is the victim of a <unk> that a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong.
In the future, most <unk> crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in terms that we see today is not driven by money.
There is another thing that moves, and the protests, the protests, they motivate them to motivate them laughter.
These are groups like Anonymous have been <unk> in the last 12 months, occupying a huge role in online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> criminals who make it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous who do it to protest and the last group are the United States, governments that <unk>
And then we see cases like the <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
<unk> the collapse last fall because of a <unk>
And I took the safety of the site and took a <unk>
The last week I said, in a meeting with Dutch government meeting asked one of the leaders if you were <unk> <unk> death of people because of the attack <unk>
And the answer was yes.
So how does people die from a attack of these?
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
What do you do?
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that they would give a foreign authority to foreign authority.
And that was the <unk> important?
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the protesters <unk> the <unk> secret police headquarters in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
The papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder, there were notes from a company based on Germany that had been sold to the Egyptian government to intercept a big scale of the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool by 3,000 euros to the Afghan government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools for governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> <unk> used by official government official to investigate their own citizens.
If you were <unk> in a criminal case, you know, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes beyond there.
It <unk> the Internet connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all communication, and to listen to online discussions to get our data.
When we think about things like these the obvious answer should be, "Well, it seems something wrong, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why is it <unk>
I don't have anything to do.
And that argument makes no sense.
It's in play privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
So if we could be confident in our governments today in 2011, any right that we have today, it will be forever.
They were blindly focused on any future government, in an administration, we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions we have to worry about in the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the South Side of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad at the background, and behind the cattle and the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi has no fences over the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, the stick and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the people who killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and we found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to do it, and that's why we value it so much.
So I grew up with a lot of <unk>
People were dying of the warriors who protect our community and livestock and livestock -- and they're also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
And I think that's why there are so few in the National Park.
A child in my community, at age six, is responsible for livestock of their father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions gave them fear.
But I realized that I don't really <unk> because I even helped lions see the pen away.
Don't get me <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
And I was trying to trick the lions to believe that I was near the <unk>
But the lions are very intelligent.  They came up the first day and saw the <unk> and they were gone, but the second day, and they came back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always moving, he's always here.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day the lions didn't come.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves around.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on that turn into the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk> <unk>
It <unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell picks up the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity into the small box. I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights down.
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where the lions.
And that's how they see the lions when they come from night.
The lights <unk> and <unk> the lions to think that I am walking around the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had a problem with lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see it, you can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've been installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving so much.
And my idea is also used by all Kenya, to frightening to other predators like hyenas, <unk> and it's also using <unk> elephants as well.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funds.
It even led my friends to my community and installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a kid on my nails, <unk> my father, and I used to see flying planes and said it would someday be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be a aviation engineer and when I grow up.
I used to hate lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and to lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to listen to a story like you.
So you got an Richard <unk> <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working in other electrical <unk>
What is the next thing on your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a fence -- CA: A near <unk>
<unk> I know that no longer were invented <unk> but I want to do mine.
CA: You know, I read it once, right?
We go to <unk> every single step my friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk>
And I felt so proud.
In school, we would come up with all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except for America, South Korea, is the enemies.
I would sometimes wondered about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until everything changed from a suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When we <unk> this, the five family members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two previous weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
It was very altered.
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
As long as I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child lying on her arms watching his own mother without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine, <unk> North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only very few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more prevalent the energy <unk> all around me, was completely dark at night except by the sea lights in China, barely crossing the river from my home.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a red picture of North Korea at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is serving between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river, in the river,
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can just say that during the years of famine was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined it would take 14 to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how life would be like refugee refugees.
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the North Koreans in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate back in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested by the Chinese police and I was scared by the police station.
Somebody had been accused by being <unk> then I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't look natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and asked the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an official said to another, "This was a false report. She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for asylum <unk>
But many people can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although the <unk> had eventually lifted up after an international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape, many other Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic than North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding jobs -- all of their world can fit in a second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to be a risk going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a very much greater challenge than I was hoping for.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We're all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call my pride of mine.
Although I went to life in South Korea it wasn't easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the exam for college.
Just when I began to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities <unk> some money that sent my family, and as blame my family was going to be shifted to the force to a location from the <unk>
They had to flee it immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border of North Korea and South Korea, and it's <unk>
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Since my family could not speak Chinese, I had to do it somehow, for over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and tackled by a official police officer.
He asked all of them to do all of them and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't really understand Chinese, I thought my family was being arrested.
When the Chinese official came to my family, <unk> I stood up and I told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately I believed it.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost my money to bribe the <unk> guards in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But at time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lower points in my life.
And I made all of my family, and we were so close to my family, but my family was <unk> in prison to short distance from the embassy of South Korea.
I was going and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or a voice of a man asking me, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would care to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the automatic <unk> and I gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and <unk>
I stood up with my heart, and I said, "Why am I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> I told you.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
And the kind of kind of kind would be unknown to me as a new hope for me and for the town of the village -- when we get it wrong.
And I showed me that the kindness of the strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I came together in South Korea, and we sat around in South Korea, and I went together.
But getting their freedom is only half the struggle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they go to a new country, they start with little or nothing money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice language practices, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in contact with family still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've got a lot of aid and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans around the world, including the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Pole.
This is Center for <unk> stores of <unk> food, fast, land.
So the city planners come together and they thought, we're going to change the name of South Center to represent something else, so they changed the South African Los Angeles as if this <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is the South Los Angeles   <unk> of <unk> fast food, land.
Just like <unk> million other Americans, I live in a food desert, Los Angeles South Africa, home from food places to take and eat in the car.
What's curious about is that places of food to get killed by more people than the food in the car.
People are dying of infectious diseases in Los Angeles South
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times greater than, say, <unk> <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
And I was trying to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how do you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of your house, you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in its <unk>
I see the wheelchair <unk> and sold as cars.
I see <unk> <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and it's the solution.
In addition I got tired of me to drive 45 minutes back and back to buy an apple that has no pesticides in it.
What I did, I was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's 45 percent by 45 feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me on wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This was how I decided to keep it.
So my group and I, the Green Green <unk> we put us together and we started to plant our forest of food, trees -- <unk> you know, those nine complete vegetables.
What we do, we are a kind of paid paid paid successfully made of all the <unk> of all the <unk> and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone got stuck.
The city came up with me and <unk> gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> made <unk>
And I would say, "Come on it?
An order court for planting food in a piece of land that nobody <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, let's <unk>
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
<unk> Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> members who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we went a success.
We had victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States of <unk> <unk>
It has <unk> miles of land.
That's 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space for planting <unk> million plants.
Why on earth don't you think about this?
<unk> a plant will be <unk> 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars to result.
It's my <unk> when I say to people, cultivate your own food.
You know, your own food is how to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Pole.
I grew up in there, and I got my kids there.
I was being part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grew up my art.
As a <unk> artist <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
It was <unk> to see what the earth can do.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witnessing how my garden became an education tool, the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
You can see how they affect the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and thought they can do, especially in a <unk>
In addition, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, that came a mother and his daughter, were like the <unk> at night, and they were in my yard, and they were looking very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that you were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame when I see people that I was so close to hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people go to steal your <unk>
So I say, "For God no, I'm not afraid you go to <unk>
That's why it's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to do it, but at the same time, I want you to hold your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, which helped me download the truck.
It was great, I gave me their stories about how this had affected them and how they used to plant their mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, and so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had, like 50 people who are coming, work and <unk> all on a volunteer plan.
If kids grow <unk> boys are eating <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this will be told if you're not taught how food affects the mind and your body, they eat blind what they put in front of.
I see young people who want to work on, but they have this thing that they're caught. I see color kids that are on this path designed for them, that doesn't lead them nowhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these guys who are getting rid of their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe there's the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take <unk> and turn them into <unk>
I don't love me.
I'm not talking about free, because it's free not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability, is that you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to put people working to people, take the boys out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
You take your <unk> take your <unk> OK?
That is the weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, you don't call me to sit in a comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very beautiful street.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days as today, when it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water on the asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if you're <unk> on your bicycle and these cars -- that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we would want a quiet road in it.
The solution for that is to make roads of asphalt roads.
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads of the Netherlands, has pores and water can go through it, so all the rain water flow down the sides and they will have a road that is easy to drive, and you don't have any water and no more.
The noise they disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very open, all the noise will disappear, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> You see that in this road the rocks of the surface goes out.
So first one stone, then then several more and more and more, and so on, and you know, I don't do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> He's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see how damage damage in this material.
It's a underperforming <unk> like I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> of light <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> are <unk> and if you get older, you're going to be <unk> and they will separate from the <unk>
So if you drive through the road, you take the <unk> like we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use steel wool from that to clean up, and we can cut the wool wool into smaller pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of wool wool in it.
And then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use to make a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you need to do is you have to heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones will come back to the surface.
Today I used a microwave oven, because I can't bring the great machine <unk> here to stage.
<unk> oven is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
We tried a lot of samples out there and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we gave us a bit of a road, 400 feet of the <unk> highway, where we had to make a test test to try this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then of course, this road last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and we test them in the lab.
We made the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, the foundation then with our <unk> machine, and we went back to a try.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using steel fibers by bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, you can even double the life of the ground, you can even double the life of the surface.
And now, of course, they're curious about whether this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
You actually have to cool it first before I can show you how repair itself.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to News <unk> in his little gray radius.
He had a big smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news generally was <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> screamed at my father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school school, he told me.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old, when the Taliban went out of Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to get my older sister to my older sister who no longer could be used outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we were able to do it.
Every day, we took a different route so that no one could be suspect where you were going.
We had to hide the books in market bags so that we were shopping.
The school was at a house, over 100 of us worked in a small room.
It was nice in winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that we <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Every time in a while, the school was suddenly <unk> because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew of us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where you <unk>
We were <unk> but yet, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> in which his daughter, my mother, went to school, and that's why her father was doing it.
But my mother educated became a teacher.
This is her.
He went back two years ago, just to turn our home home to girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk to don't educate her children.
During the years of <unk> I remember there were times that I was very frustrated by our life, and she was always scared and I couldn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter, me, you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can help leave your home for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will do.
So you still want not to <unk>
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that's been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than the high school, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate College.
When I returned to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from his home to educate his daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He doesn't just get rid of my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I carried it on the streets of Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream in big, but my family has even more big dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
That's why <unk> <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
What's exciting is I see students in my school with the strong desire to leverage the opportunity.
And I look at their parents and their families who, like the mine, and they were looking at them even in front of an opposition <unk>
As <unk> It's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to his village, and literally escaped to be killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, they are the phone, a voice <unk> him that if he kept sending her daughter to school, they would go back to try.
<unk> already, if you were going, "but they don't harm the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've got to tell you about Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of her daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers haven't been key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under <unk> the girls who went to school, remember, was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of the changes.
And I think these changes didn't last too much after retirement in the U.S. troops ...
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who were asking for them, that the <unk> I see a future and a lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities and <unk> and every day the girls of <unk> I would give up.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I've never never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never get to have a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution inspired by the wave of mass <unk> both the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other <unk> citizens inside and outside the country to call a day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a great revolution.
Women and young men were in the <unk> <unk> the fall of the regime, and these are billboards of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You've shown a courage to face the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of the brutal war and a loss of about 50 thousand people were able to release our country and remove the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy burden -- a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> out of the devastation and the challenges, I've dear to do, along with many other women, to rebuild the civilian civil society -- <unk> a neural transition and just to democracy and national reconciliation, and the national reconciliation, and the national reconciliation, and the national reconciliation society.
There was about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the decline of <unk> About 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I began to organize workshops about the development of capacities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we founded the Women of Women founded the Women of women -- <unk> for <unk> -- a movement of women, leaders, very <unk> to advocate for the reproductive autonomy of the woman and for our right to participate in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly <unk> which is <unk> of the selfish <unk> of domination, and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was FDA and successful.
Women won a <unk> of National Congress in the first elections.
However, slowly the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, they were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of <unk> and ancient mosques and <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador, and the attack <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder murder of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and their avoided human rights violations.
Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mindset -- it gets more <unk> and it has away from the ideals and early of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had at the beginning.
<unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all to match us with our story of the success of <unk> <unk> and the election.
Rather, I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation -- we chose wrong, we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize okay.
Because the election did not brought peace and stability and safety to Libya.
The <unk> list and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation, <unk>
No, they didn't.
So what happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and this is dominated with selfish selfish policies and <unk> for men as for women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than I needed the election -- that just <unk> the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the reproductive representation of women more than going to need to be able to be able to be able to be a rendering of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of anger and calling days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, which not only <unk> but also to put it into practice <unk> instead of <unk> collaboration instead of competition, the inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> for war, needs desperately to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we form it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> that unfolds all the humanity from which men and women that all tribes and all the villages have been <unk>
And so, just like the uterus covers completely <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion is <unk> all the existence.
This is how it comes to us, "My mercy takes all the things."
So it comes to us, "My mercy <unk> about my <unk>
That all of us are <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a curious question that has an equally <unk> response.
This is about the secrets of domestic violence and the question I'm going to deal with is everybody who is <unk> Why is it left?
Why was somebody going to stay with a man who <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, not an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story I'll count.
I was 22 years old, I had just been at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> green <unk> and I had a very big secrecy.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my alma mater, me to my head with a <unk> <unk> with bullets from <unk>
The man, when she loved anyone in this world, put a gun in my head, and I would have <unk> with <unk> more times as I can remember.
I'm here to tell you about the story of <unk> <unk> a wonderful <unk> of love, where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be your story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA at <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> list between these Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I drive a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all of the religions, every income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse only happens in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> or said otherwise in families, the last place where we would want or expect to find <unk> reason why, drug abuse, is so puzzling.
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would stay with a man who sticks, and I actually was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women in the age of 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence victims than other ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by couples, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also was a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold and rainy night of January.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and started to describe it with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a university of <unk> <unk> and I worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that seemed a guy in the field.
He had some big <unk> and a <unk> and wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the very beginning, was creating the illusion that I was the dominant person of mate.
He did it all over the beginning <unk> in a <unk>
We started coming out and loved all of me, which was list that I had gone to Harvard, who would put passion to help girls, teenage girls, and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a woman, and as a woman, as no one had ever done.
And it was why I was in that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and his brilliant future was so much important for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any terms of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was go out of New York and leave the job of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I <unk> I left my job and <unk> and I went together from Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling on a <unk> <unk> which was getting head into a physical, financial trap and carefully ready.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And this is where they come into the scene of those <unk>
So as soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where you're supposed to feel like I had to feel so safe she bought three <unk>
One had the car <unk>
Another one was placed under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said I needed those guns to the trauma that lived in a little boy.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never opened my hand, my life was already at risk for every single day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put the girlfriend suit.
Despite what happened, I was sure that we were living happy forever, because I loved him, and he also wanted me so much.
And I was very, very <unk>
It had just felt very <unk> for the wedding and the fact that they form a family with me.
I had been a isolated accident, and I would never hurt me.
I spent two times more in our moon.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that I <unk> several times against the car <unk>
And then a couple of days later, driving back from our mother's moon, they went through the traffic and threw me a Big Mac to my face.
<unk> went on for a week or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was amazed when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is being a domestic violence victim or bullying at some point in their life, and the Disease Control Center for each year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why do I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly <unk> man who was the only person in the world who could help <unk> face their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why don't you just not <unk>
Why did I not <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and agonizing question that people do because we have the victims, we know something that normally you are, it's incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killings in terms of domestic violence occur after the victim has finally put the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include the permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has returned to marry, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family management system to <unk> the victim and their children, who are usually forced by the judges to spend time without the man who supports their mother.
And we still keep asking why it's just not.
I was able to go, because of the last guy -- beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody about the world: the police, my neighbors, my friends and family, to full strangers, and I'm here today because all of you.
We have the tendency to <unk> the victims as <unk> <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why do you <unk>
For some people is a way of saying "The fault of <unk> as if the victims of the <unk> were flooded with men who want to <unk>
But since I released <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also assume that they learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to them and that they would raise their lives and lives and happy lives like <unk> wives and mothers, completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic domestic violence.
I got married with a nice, cute man, and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to do is never even more, it's a <unk> <unk> pointing my head in the hands of someone who says I will.
At this moment, as you are thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> what silly stupid time, I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, that they're being <unk> or that they were <unk> or they're <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting their daughter, her sister, his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love that I end up to my particular love breaking silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
substance abuse just in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They had the <unk> of light talking about it with their children, their coworkers and family.
They opened his vision of survivors like fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to stop their climb and show the victims of a safe safely.
And together we can turn our beds, our tables and our families and our families in the <unk> and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call <unk> Cameron and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years.
And I feel like right now there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed in like this.  Luckily, I brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first shift of clothing on a stage of <unk> so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to stand now, but find out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think of myself in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These heels. They're very <unk> less than I have to use.
The worst part is going through this sweater by the head, because it's when they're going to laugh at me, so I don't do anything as the head of your head.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope it's not as much as this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but also <unk>
I have changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer said to me that he would take my back, and you would take the hair out of the kid.
Of course, except with surgery or a deep <unk> like the one that I made two days ago for work, there is very little that we can do to transform our aspect, which, while superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave it means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I am a model,
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's a sexy girl in my job.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made myself model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this inheritance.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty and youth and symmetry, which we're biologically programmed to <unk> we also have the associated with a high and <unk> shape and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> heritage that I have known to take to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now showing <unk> and maybe there's some <unk> <unk> <unk> There are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing so much of models.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told every single models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- I mean, less than four percent, they were not white.
So the next question that people always ask me is: Can I be a model when you get older.
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't take for that.
But then what I would really tell you to each one of these girls is: Why? You can be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a computer-generated surgeon and poet, which would be awesome, because you're the first.
If after this a spectacular list, still <unk> no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I tell you, I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the head of the American magazine or the American executive director, or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model to say that you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to demonstrate everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike the <unk> surgery, it can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've got your studies, and you have a copy and a few jobs and a few jobs on your back, no matter what you want, if you will, that you want to be president of the United States, but you know, I'm going to get them to get a Model from inner clothes for 10 years, people would look at you.
The next question that people always do is if all of the pictures are <unk>
And yeah, you know, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my time.
I know we're getting into the personal field, but it was a child.
This was how I wore my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party, a few days before the photos for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are <unk> from a professional group of professionals, and photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people are always asking me is, do things for for free?
I have too much six inches taller and I didn't use, except the previous couple of time, but the privilege I get is the I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a store and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the free dress.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> jumped in a red light and of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent -- agent <unk>
And I think of these privilege for me, and not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for how much no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of the teenagers who were left and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black black men in New York, so for them, it's not a matter of <unk>
But how many times do I get <unk> and <unk>
When I research for this talk, I learned about that to 53 percent of 13 girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes to 78 percent in the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is the life of a model? model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little bit thinner and you have the brightest hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe so <unk>
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to work with creative and smart people.
And that's true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my aspect every day.
And if you ever go and ask a little shorter legs and the most bright hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a bunch of models, because they have the <unk> legs -- the brightest hair and the <unk> and the <unk> women are physically <unk> women on the planet.
But especially it was hard to look at a situation of racial oppression and gender when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something to retain this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable at recognizing the power of the image of the image that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was much older enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 <unk> photos -- and I didn't go to the <unk>
There were no opportunity directors and no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even a minimum of <unk>
In fact, most they took them empty tourists actually.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of the 57 birthday.
He happened that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said to me, why don't you take you to <unk> to New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
So here is when we started to ask for tourists who were going to take us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete unknown is so universal.
No one has been denied and, fortunately, no one has <unk> with the camera.
So we were not aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became sacred to us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day as a 10-year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more that representations of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way of stopping time on a week of October and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, although we always took the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter gets new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something we hope with illusion every year.
Recently, in one of the travels we were walking. We were walking, when all of a sudden, it was stopped in my tracks and pointed out a red <unk> of the fruit store, which would be <unk> in the previous <unk>
And I described to me what was the five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> which remembered his heart is <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you see in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And I suddenly understood that one of the most important things we create is memory.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that comes out of the picture.
Today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and I didn't go back to someone and ask him, and he gets us a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most unequal birds group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It also has been associated with Disney laughs as <unk> dumb characters, stupid characters.
More recently, if you have been following the press and laughter applause, and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament -- but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment clean --  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   They're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World who found mainly in the <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> of the World Bank, where we have 16 species -- of these 16, 11 face a high risk of extinction.
So why do the <unk> are important? First of all, they provide health ecological services.
It's our <unk> of natural waste.
They <unk> the cadavers up to bone.
They help kill all of the bacteria. They help to absorb the anthrax that they're not going to be through them and caused great losses of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge historically important.
They've been associated with ancient <unk> culture.
<unk> was the symbol of the lip and maternity <unk> and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between <unk> and under Egypt.
In the mythology -- <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
In <unk> culture, they do a lot of important <unk> to open sky. In places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead, or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being torn is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> communities, <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the endangered endangered list, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years is <unk> and the reason is because they fall out of the fuel of livestock and the <unk> <unk>
This drug has been banned by using veterinarian in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs <unk> in <unk> <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs -- you have a huge amount of time for <unk> the number of cases has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up to the <unk> lake.
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments because wind turbines do this to birds. They cut them in half.
They're <unk>
In West Africa, there is a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve the <unk> and the market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're doing these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine its basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so you can focus on a silent problem that's not going to be anything.
We need to work with governments on the <unk> levels.
We're working with the local communities.
We are talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can you help? It can become assets, make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, they will report on the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said he changed because he saw it fly without effort, no energy energy in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young, but I am not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa from <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for a <unk> NGO and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
We went to the 21st of us that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, all I would have to do -- all I <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where we just decided to teach people to evolve to grow food.
So we got with seed seeds to the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent Valley that descends into the river <unk> and we teach the local people to grow Italians and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, people were not at all who were interested in doing that, so they asked them to come to work -- and sometimes they don't have to come to work, and we were just rather than locals -- in such <unk> valley, they hadn't had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible to do anything, we just said, "Thank God that we are here."  Let's take time to save the people in Zambia from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these gorgeous <unk> In Italy, a tomato tomato down to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> Look at how easy it is.
When the tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red, from the night to the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said, "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> they said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you say, "You're never <unk>
I thought that only we Italians make mistakes in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, did what the English did, what they did -- and then to see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> to see the <unk>  <unk> look at the waste that we give to the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
Don't tell you about damage that money has <unk>
Just read his book.
<unk> from part of an African woman, the damage we've done.
non-Western Westerners are a <unk> missionaries and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the root Latin <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I try any of a different culture as if you were my children, "I want a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of the different culture as if you were my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap in the face, "The <unk> is <unk> written by <unk> who said for all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk>
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the floor and said, we can do -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to ask the 27 years to just answer people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you have never motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? They <unk>
You can never get to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We put together in a cafe. We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what's going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not, for one time, they <unk> but not in community meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
<unk> never <unk> and they will never tell them in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, which opportunity have been identified.
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't take their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face-to-face you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You have to create a new job.
The profession is the family doctor member of the company, the family doctor of the business, which sets up with you in your house, at the table of your kitchen in the coffee, and that helps you find the resources to transform her passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia, City.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to move away from this condescending garbage where we came to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects going, and the government came to see me to ask, "How can you do that?
How can you do it? And I said, "I did something very, very difficult.
And so I went to me, and --   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> student in history, passed away '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a philosophy professor before you get involved in business, and this is what Peter says Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
Design is the kiss of death of the business spirit.
So now we <unk> <unk> <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come up with you with you.
You have to offer you, privacy, you have to be fantastic to <unk> and then they will come up in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What are you going to look at you guys -- this is the morning?
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the spirit spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution, <unk> fossils are not <unk> <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do that.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
<unk>
They'll be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a beautiful story that I read in serious magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year <unk> they gathered this group of people and <unk> to what happened to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City would not be within 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population is kept growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses -- would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk> in dung.  So, in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that would <unk> New York lives.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in 1900, in the United States appeared <unk> generic companies, <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories called <unk> <unk>
<unk> Michigan. Michigan.
However, there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you.
Otherwise, they won't come up with you.
And then you have to offer us an absolute devoted <unk>
And then you have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller, smaller company, the biggest company, it has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic marketing -- you have to tell with a fantastic financial administration.
Do you know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can be done, sell to the money alone.
No exist.
This is not born.
We have looked at and looked at the 100 icons of the Carnegie <unk> <unk> Company, Ford, all the new companies, Google <unk>
There's only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common, only one was started by one person.
I would never have the word -- but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
Nobody begins a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business <unk> environment in coffee bars with their dedicated dancers who will be going to you, what someone did for you, what someone did for this <unk> who speaks to you, what needs you to need?
What can you do? Can you do it?
Well, you can look at the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." <unk> you see you <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't change a lot of knowledge despite sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much do my neighbors pay for their <unk>
How can we lend to borrow more things without calling the door at a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do you share more our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs.
I live in New <unk> and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> which give shadows to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries ago, and I trust a city in a city.
It always gives the music.  There's a show in New York --  The city has one of the most beautiful developments in the world, but also one with the largest population of U.S. <unk>
I live close to this house, and I thought how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood, and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother for <unk>
Their death was suddenly and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and I thought a lot.
And this produced me a profound gratitude for the time and the time that was living with me.
It led to the meaningful things about my life today.
But I want to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch up the day and forget the really important thing for one.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this left house on a giant board and he painted on her phrases to <unk> "Before he was talking about dying <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to expect about this experiment, but the next day, the wall was filled with me and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die I want to be <unk> by <unk>  "Before I die I want to sit on the line of <unk>
Before I die I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I die I want to plant a <unk>
Before I die I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I die I want to hear you once more."
Before I died I want to go to the rescue rescue.
Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at me, and they gave me solace in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new and <unk> and it's about supporting the reflection and <unk> and to remember what is the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues of civic center, we did a kit kit and now has made walls in countries around the world, like South Africa, and South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if you give us ourselves ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is the time and our relations with other people.
In our era of distractions increasing, it's more important than ever, to find the ways of preserving the perspective and remember that life is short and fragile.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that preparing for death is one of those things that give us more power.
If you think about death -- our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect what we care as individuals and as a community and with more media to share hopes for hope and stories, the people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single petition.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 and very hot.
We don't talk about, but it transmits joy that some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
You share it <unk> pass it on.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious and religious differences in this: Never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to <unk> the words that I didn't even know I could <unk> it reminds me one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
It monitors the more <unk>
However, it's a <unk> memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but remember the year that came out of my iPod, conversations that we maintained when I was four years old, I pee in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
They don't seem <unk>
But most people don't agree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled me to my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though you don't consider them inside of it, that could only mean one thing: which were <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In every individual, it manifests in a different form of a different way, which is so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed with a new case of autism, and although it's one of the disorders of the development of the development that are faster on the world, there is no cause no cure for <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years old, when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new one in my life.
When I spent a few months, I realized he was different.
Thank you very much.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and in fact, didn't seem very interested in me at all.
I lived living and <unk> in his own world, with her own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars in row around the room, looking at the machine, looking at anything that would be <unk>
As I was growing up, it becomes more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature -- a child who saw the world without <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there's been some difficult moments in my family, moments where I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the back of the things that have taught me about individuality, and the love, and I realize that they're things that wouldn't want to change by normal.
<unk> is the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means there's a different vision of what's right.
If you could <unk> one thing to <unk> and to Sam and you don't have to be normal.
It can be extraordinary.
Because, <unk> or not, the differences you <unk> are a <unk> each of us has a gift in their interior, and frankly, the pursuit of normal, is the ultimate <unk>
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time where we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what it must be <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>
Penn University asked me, a communications teacher -- that I would give a media class to engineering students.
I was scared.  I was really scared -- these students with their great minds, their big books and their big <unk> and <unk> words.
But in the middle of those conversations -- I felt what <unk> must have felt when she fell through the hole of the rabbit and saw the door of a new world.
Just like this I felt when I had those conversations with the students, I was surprised by the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges from energy to half the health and health care environment between others, and if we don't know about this, work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please stop them with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why is science relevant to us.
Don't tell us just to study the <unk> but they study the <unk> which are the structure structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing your science, you care about <unk>
The slang is a obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing to make them stupid enough.
Instead, as Einstein said, that everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without compromise ideas.
One thing to consider is using examples, stories and analogies that are <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And when you present his work, forget about the signs of <unk>
You have wondered why they're called <unk>  What do they do <unk> the bullets kill, and kill their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's supported too much in the language area of our brain and we get into it.
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that really inspired the single design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple phrase <unk> that the public can understand if you lost a little bit, and then provide graphs that <unk> our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what you want.
I think these are just a few keys that can help the other open the door and look at the country of wonders which is science and engineering.
And so scientists, and engineers, when you've solved this equation, all means, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all of my favorite English words is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor of the 19th century that defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is those who seeks a public care, no matter whether or platform, and that, when wins, got it for the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means.
One thing to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all of the politicians know they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament enabled the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said to the exact words of the <unk>
And all of this was thanks to the bravery of a guy with the <unk> name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted by Parliament.
He was thrown in the Tower of London and <unk> but he had enough courage to cope with them, and in the end, he had such popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's a literal way.
It's not. It's because of a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you back to America, just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
Didn't you know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This was <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They introduced all kinds of suggestions you could have <unk>
Some people wanted to call it <unk> state and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the American People in the U.S.
Not very <unk>
Some they wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was proven to be <unk>
And not even with it they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a limited term.
And I could have <unk>
Everybody got tired <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and I always had this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the <unk> House was against the <unk>
The <unk> House didn't want Washington to be <unk>
They didn't want to call it the King for him or he was giving her ideas.
So they wanted to give the most more <unk> and most unfortunate title that we were supposed to do.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invent the title. There was just before, but it only meant <unk> that he would take a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> but it was actually a <unk> degree.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take serious with a degree that was so ridiculous and insignificant as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate doesn't exist.
We can learn three interesting things from all of this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I have been able to figure out, the Senate has never <unk> it was the title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to stay there, waiting for the Senate between in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible to stay waiting for years more.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and with this -- is that the president of President <unk> doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads -- the world's largest economy and a fleet of air vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story has endowed with the title of <unk>
So I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern in the Senate, looked like, well, it was a uniqueness of the time.
But you know how many nations you have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end the Senate he won and the House of Representatives -- because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that now is the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that that I would like to <unk>
Political are trying to choose and use words to shape and control reality, but really, really change the words much more the words than these could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to feet under land in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is <unk> and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about it, but above all, this cacophony of male <unk> and stones with primitive.
Like others, I've been wearing a cheap light of light that holds it onto my head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that they hold the walls of that hole from that hole and drop out of hundreds of feet on the ground.
And I went through my hand, and I suddenly remember a mining that I met days before, who lost control and dropped <unk> feet on that well.
As I talk to you today, these men are sitting deep at that hole, and their lives without a reward and, often, dying.
I went out of that hole, and I went home but they probably never will.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> at the Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met with a <unk> of <unk> the <unk> an NGO who is engaged in eradicating modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not to just grade.
When we ended up talking very sad, I was honestly <unk> to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me <unk> the stomach and weeks later, I flew Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So my journey started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
And I even considered them my second home.
But this time, we <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are over 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of African Africans in the whole of the slave <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about <unk> we have today.
However, today you can provide entire families for generations per debts of 18.
Amazingly, slavery generates revenue from over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to find out that they're forced to work without pay, of violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery will operate in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
The slavery exists in almost everybody -- and yet it's illegal throughout the world.
In India and <unk> I met the bricks.
This weird show and formidable was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, children, in fact, <unk> families -- in a heavy, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in their head, to 18 at the time, to 18 to the time, and they take them out of <unk> <unk>
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work silent, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no cup to eat, or to drink, and severe <unk> I did just pee quite <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too warm to touch and he stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a lot better than these people.
Back in <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said to me, <unk> don't do it."
And he explained to me very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me, but for them.
I couldn't offer them any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I was not citizen of that country.
I could put them in a worse situation than they were already.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his liberation and trusted me to do it.
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found children carrying rocks for miles per miles by <unk> <unk> to trucks that were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children and the children would put them onto their heads with mud straps made out of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some of them don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all their life.
Do you have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, the <unk> they had completely <unk>
When you hear the word <unk> often we think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness, me told me that it would be difficult for me to work safely in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously used sex.
It drove me up a little bit of <unk> that gave this dirty basement, <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, are local in the craft, for forced prostitution.
They have small, small, private rooms, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of the only seven years -- they're forced to entertain clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each roll is dark and dirty -- identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their clients.
On the <unk> I remember being a <unk> <unk> <unk> and, at that time, I could barely imagine what it should be to be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where you were <unk>
There was no <unk>
There were no windows and big enough to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we play a very difficult issue, it's important to point out that slavery -- even sexual trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
So recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 people were sold every year as a sex slave die.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to the labor of <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families living in the silk.
This is a family portrait of family.
The black hands are the father, the <unk> of blue and red, from their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> the silk on the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me his stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, though, being able to leave this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we got there, I went to get a quick look.
I saw what seemed to be a fishing family on a boat, two older brothers, some younger kids, some of the younger kids have felt right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their families <unk> <unk> and forced to work <unk> in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came over to me he was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
<unk> branches of trees plunged into Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and fear, they're thrown into the water to unlock the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of her love is not going to flee and like every life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> tries to younger slaves under their charge.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they <unk> the last networks, but they had been working on the last one.
On the cold night and <unk>
And it will point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're loaded with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village village.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes is possible.
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make a difference in your life?
They ran down a road in Ghana with <unk> partners the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his ranch and <unk> our car and played the window.
He asked us to do it by a land path to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we would get rid of the car, and he asked the driver to come out quickly.
And then he pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the path.
As we start down, we took off the <unk> that I would put on the road, and after walking close to an hour, we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put my pictures of photos on my head as I put in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a soccer camp and all were full of <unk> workers.
Many women had their children strapped on their backs and, as they were looking for gold, <unk> in <unk> water.
The <unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These miners are embedded in a good part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember he looked at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The wells they have to 90 feet and these people have got heavy bags bags that then they'll be transported to another area where they put the stone to get the gold.
In the first sight, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer at the edge of the side, we see a little less fortunate, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ended up like this victim of T.B. and the <unk> of <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died he took him to work with him in the mines.
By dying of his uncle, he was able to inherit the debt of the uncle, what force will be a slave in mines.
When I met her, I had been working in 14 years and the injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet, it's forced to work on night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dreams with being liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, to a remote possibility -- which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw light about slavery.
Did you know that his images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we'll give testimony to them and that we're going to do everything to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They are from people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights and dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I think I don't think about these so many beautiful people, <unk> that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images show a force in which you can see them in people like you, and I hope that force turns out a fire and that that fire would turn light into slavery because without that light, the beast the beast the beast the beast the beast the beast the beast the beast the beast that slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do mathematical math and there's a peculiar problem for whom <unk> we are like management technology;
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I will try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of the ballet and the dancers.
But the ballet demand is a degree of extraordinary, extraordinary training -- a high level of dexterity and probably some initial <unk> that may well have a genetic component.
Sadly, psychiatric disease as Parkinson's disease, destroy this extraordinary ability, such as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in their time, was a <unk> a <unk> <unk>
In the last few years, it has been moved in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a weakness of <unk> <unk> stiffness and other symptoms of this disease, so we need free tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we will know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective and an objective metric and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of movement -- no biological markers -- so they don't serve the blood analysis, and the best thing we have is a neurological exam test.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that we were in clinical trials, never being done. It's never done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if the patients could be done to ourselves?
I wouldn't need to be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do -- as a conventional <unk> form, you see, in some sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of the <unk> ropes.
It shows someone healthy while you get it out to speak. We can imagine as dancers of a vocal ballet dancers because we have to coordinate all of those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes that we need -- for example.
And as they did it, it requires an extraordinary <unk>
Think about how long it takes a child to learn to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as <unk> and as Parkinson's does affect the <unk> it also affects the organs.
In the traces of the bottom you can see an example of the <unk> of strings of <unk>
We see the same <unk>
Israeli <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice of clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
They're both <unk> OK, but also testing boards are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds a lot.
It's at the minimum cost and we all know what happens happens.
When you get a huge amount of cost. It appears on mass scale.
These are some amazing ones ready to <unk>
We can reduce the health difficulties from patients.
You wouldn't need to go to the clinic for the <unk> of routine.
We often could be able to get goals.
We could do it low cost for clinical trial for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have a chance to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when I give you today the first steps in that sense, we're launching the so-called Parkinson's disease.
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start addressing these goals.
We have local lines accessible to about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with <unk> or without <unk> it can call low price for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal for only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So I'm going to take all these samples of, let's say 10,000 people -- you'll be able to say who's healthy and who isn't it?
What come from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you need to indicate whether or not the disease. Yeah.
<unk> You see, some people may not <unk> You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances, it's important because we're looking for the factors of confusion in looking for the actual markers of the disease.
TR: Do you have a accuracy <unk> at this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my student, <unk> I have that <unk> has done a fantastic job and now has shown that it works in the mobile network cell as well, what we did -- the project -- now we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We spread in the dark, in no windows and no windows and generally <unk>
We do the <unk> models even more <unk> the perfect skin we do the impossible -- we do the impossible -- and we would be interested in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste of the images and the photograph.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that happened in Japan.
Just a long time later, an organization where I was the <unk> where <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the team of response.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little fishing town in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the earliest people affected by the wave.
The blood level recorded over 24 feet tall and over three miles land inside.
As you can imagine, the people was <unk>
<unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
They went out, we removed the slime and leave the houses ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We removed tons of dead fish and tons of dead fish.
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> of photos and cameras and punch cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
<unk> and take them to different places from villages around them to <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to leave absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean up, giant bathrooms -- gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had them -- and I had the honor that that day was going to take me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard the expression of thinking beyond <unk> but it wasn't until I myself my horizons something happened.
By looking at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years of a hundred years of the lab, they were still in the lab, I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive and I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
I wasn't too <unk> but where the water was <unk> the face of the girl had a lot of precision and <unk>
Otherwise, that little girl would not have the appearance of it, and that would be so tragic as having the photo <unk>
With the step of time, they came by lucky enough, and they got more <unk> so I went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries were offered to help.
Within two weeks he had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were invited to <unk> a village to Northern <unk>
And once we have this scanner and we use our scanner in the temporal libraries.
The time that I <unk> in <unk> is a different story, it depended on the course of the photos.
It could be an hour of an hour. It could be <unk>
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw up very much hand using the areas that the color of the color and detail the water was not <unk>
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures per water takes in saltwater, covered in bacteria, with algae, and even with oil, all of it along with the step of time, still <unk> so I <unk> hand was an important part of the project.
We couldn't get the picture unless it was clean clean, dry and had been replaced by her <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We tell the guidance of a remarkable <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more the photos we have <unk>
As I once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures were lucky to the photos.
He had started <unk> her same but he stopped realizing that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his own face couldn't have been able to reconstruct it, we were able to tap the images into a single photo and take the whole picture.
When I picked up their pictures shared some of his story with us.
A colleagues of her husband found the pictures at a fire station between the rubble quite far from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues <unk>
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Their youngest children, not so small now, but their two children were at school.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took him a week to find his family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave her photos his little younger son <unk>
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that he could do -- something that he could go back to look, something I could remember from the past he would not have been marked along that day in March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1.1 volunteers had joined up there -- hundreds of them helped us clean up more than <unk> and the big <unk> -- the vast majority of their <unk> <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us bring back to 90 families and all hundreds of photos completely <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend over <unk> in equipment and materials, most of them in ink <unk>
We took pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, one relationship, a loved one guy.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would do, but the first thing that we would look for.
This was the project to restore little pieces of humanity, to return to someone who has the past.
When you get back to someone, it makes a huge difference in the life of the person that you get in.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected to something bigger with something larger to give back something, using their talent for something that is not thin models of perfect skin.
I would like to read this email -- I sent him Cindy the day that I returned from Japan after six months.
While I was <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small child, gathering around a baby, <unk> me because a similar picture of my family -- my mother, and my mother, <unk> <unk> <unk> of our wall.
In the entire world, in all the few our basic needs is the same. Right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us to wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in one millionth of just one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion, but a trillion frames per second.
So I present to you a new type of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create videos in slow motion of light in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-rays, and really challenging the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and switch on and put it into a second or a second one -- in a number of <unk> I create a <unk> stimulus package.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a bullet <unk>
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do you spread the photons into this <unk>
What is the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --   remember that all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk>   <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a <unk> package that starts <unk> and that, inside, starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> going to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel through the table and because of the reflections of the <unk> you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights were <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and current and we make it go down the same distance and we see it slow to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to see that film?
One day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring movie --  of a slow bullet in motion.
And how about testing <unk>
You can see the waves out of the table, the tomato table and the wall of the background.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way that nature paints a picture, and I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full array of view.
But if you look at one more time, you realize that, as the light leaves the tomato sauce, they still bright. They don't <unk>
Why? Because the tomato sauce is <unk> and the light bounces off its inside and it goes back after several <unk> in a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phones, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check whether fruit is grown without having to <unk>
What do we create this camera at MIT? MIT?
As photographers, you know, if you take a picture at the low exposure, it goes very little <unk>
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the <unk> <unk> so I just got into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very pristine <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of these data in raw and sort of interesting <unk>
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, right?
And if a new power of a future <unk> let him look after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You're going to go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera, to the camera, until the camera, until the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will come back to the camera, but interestingly, slightly different moments.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique capabilities to it.
It has very good time resolution and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what dot corresponds to what a distance.
When you project a laser -- you can record a photo, that you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But we'll take a lot of images like that, tens of images, the <unk> and we will try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we pull this out from the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what is around the curve, on the <unk>
Or we could look for survivors of dangerous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows.
Or we could build <unk> able to see the inside of the body by using <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and blood -- this is quite difficult, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new modality of visualization to solve the problems of media in health of the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he does a scientist, he became a science of art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collect every time are not just for scientific visualizations but we can be able to do it.
It creates a new form of computer photography with slow camera and code of colors.
And let's look at those waves. Remember, the time between each of those waves is just about <unk> a second.
But here's a lot of fun.
If you look at the waves underneath the <unk> these are going on.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order where the events occur in the world sometimes appears to the camera.
We put the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can transform life, and gives you individual freedom.

With a cell phone, you can tweet a protest and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone, you can record a song, and then put it a little bit famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to this town.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all these people gather that they would be looking for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who are a cell phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones.
<unk> <unk> a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot, almost everybody has a cell phone.
But I'm going to talk about me today about my mobile, and how life changed me.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
That's raw data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the Commission in the E.U. presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk>
This directive says that every telephone company, European company, every single Internet of Europe, has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who is sending a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile, where we are.
All of this information is stored by at least six months, and to two years, in your phone company, or its Internet provider or its Internet provider or its Internet provider or its Internet provider or its Internet provider or its Internet provider or its Internet provider or its Internet provider or its Internet provider or its Internet provider or its Internet provider or its Internet provider or its Internet
And all over Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the Berlin streets and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of Eastern Europe.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time you use the <unk>
So I asked my phone phone -- <unk> <unk> that at that time, it was the largest telephone company in Germany, which for me, <unk> all the information you had about me.
I asked them once, and I got them to ask yourself, and I didn't get a concrete answer -- it was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to ask myself a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end of the end, I <unk>
I put the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the directive in the E.U.
So I got this ugly little little little brown on a CD inside.
And in the CD there were this.
Thirty and five thousand miles of information.
And I watched you and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should you do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where step night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information to <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data means.
So along with <unk> <unk> and Open up City, we did this.
This is a visualization for six months of my life.
You can zoom in and fold up, go back and forward.
You can see every step I give you.
And you can see how I go from <unk> to <unk> and what often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives you a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
It's all of us.
First of all, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, we talk about a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call it between them.
And then you call the other, and the other one another, and we end up with this great communications network.
You can see how your people communicate to each other and what time you call each other, what time you sleep.
You can see this all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who speaks to whom, who sends an email to who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in 1989, you have a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders were, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, neither is the fall of <unk>
Because today state agencies and businesses want to store so much information from us as possible and outside the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and they want to be <unk> forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When they come home to your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value of the 21st century and it's not been past fashion.
When you go home, you get to your representative for the representative of just because business agencies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what they store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that goes to them to remember they have to fight for <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
That's not enough.
Hello, TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why we spend all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
and Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. is not genetics.
It's not <unk> you can't <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, although they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of you in the present one.
They feel bad about me, because at some point in life, you wish to be disabled
Let's walk.
<unk> <unk> are in the mall, drive in circles and parking lot and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled places.
And they think, "God, can I be at least a little bit <unk>
Moreover, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. is just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm <unk> Muslim woman, disabled and alive in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I'm from Park in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood my neighborhood and my disease had the same initial <unk>
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I can.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe at the moment.
The mantra of my father was, "Can you help me <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three older sisters were going to public school, my parents went to the school system, and they would be convinced that I would also go, and if we were not going to take all the ultimate note -- my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the age of five years, putting my fingers on his feet and just walking.
Another tactical thing that I used was to hang on a dollar in front of me to make it <unk>
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten kindergarten I was walking like a <unk> driver, which has received many <unk>
By growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they're still all of the family --  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as a <unk>
The people that I grew up had had no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed <unk> a lot of hunger for <unk>
I said that I had enough fat to live three months without eating, so <unk> at dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford the physical therapy, so I was sent to school dance.
I learned to dance with <unk> whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I do too.
And when my friends were going to spend summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid that if we didn't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were interested in <unk>
On the summer holidays often my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk from my head, threw myself warm on the back, and I remember the water <unk> and I remember the water, and I remember <unk> <unk>
But <unk> cure was yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before I do yoga it was an comedian of <unk> that I couldn't stand in <unk> <unk>
And now I can put it on your head.
My parents would give up this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital <unk>
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a scholarship to <unk> University of the state of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> pet of the theater.
I all got stuck.
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I took the top note in my classroom, and also in her classes.
Every time I did a scene from the zoo of glass -- my teachers <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow into Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with brain palsy,
I was a girl with <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> When I finally got a <unk>
I have paralysis <unk>
At the end of the end, we finally got to see it.
Thank God <unk> I finally am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it Brown. Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the director of the theater, crying historically, as if somebody had killed my cat, to ask her why and she told me that because they believed that I couldn't make the stunts
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk stunts I can't do the <unk>
It was a role in which it literally had been born and gave an actor without cerebral <unk>
The college was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors with no disabled papers.
As I graduated, I went home, and my first tour, he tour, was just as extra in a <unk>
My dream came true.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I was there as a <unk> I didn't see it more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the stopping directors of not <unk> actors -- not white, with disabilities.
We just prescribe people perfect.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
In my first tour, I took comic comics from New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when he went at high speed on the New Jersey highway with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in <unk> everybody in the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> in the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little <unk> that says that women are not fun, and they find very fun.
In 2003, my brother's brother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> Festival of New York, now in its 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of <unk> in the media, and to remind those directors of the domain that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
It was much easier to fight against the challenge of the stigma <unk>
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the news program by cable to San <unk>
I walked as if I went to a graduate school dance, I went back to a studio and they sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can you give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I clung to the desktop desk to not get out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew I would never come back to me.
But not just Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was kind of <unk> full-time and hit my chair.
Something fun I learned right with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It is said that kids are <unk> but they never get rid of me or older than me.
Suddenly my disability on the Internet became <unk>
I saw clips online, like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite example: <unk> <unk>
What does the disease have?
We should really pray for her."
A guy suggested even I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If somebody in a wheelchair can't make <unk> then <unk> you can't make someone in <unk>
<unk> are the <unk> Yeah, <unk> man.
The people who are the largest minority in the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said that I don't know. But I'm here in front of you.
However, I grew up with media, I don't think <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need to need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I arrived in the red carpet of red carpet by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I came to act in a movie with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world has become <unk>
I was <unk> by the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give kids Syrian refugees -- a tiny part of what my parents were telling me.
It was the only time my father saw myself in alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a small town.
I don't know their name, but I know his story.
It lives in a small town to the South <unk>
These people are near <unk>
<unk> drives the little town to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it goes to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, there are no work, nor about the future.
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day he was about a man who offered him to <unk> after dinner, and she <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives it a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send your family home.
They show a young lady.
They finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, bursts a car bomb.
That child in that small village with dreams of the great city was the terrorist bomber -- and that dynamic group of people were a terrorist organization connected to al Qaeda.
So how did the story of a small kid in a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that came back.
This was the first thing that pulled it out of what we call "the <unk>
And their story is repeating in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young unemployed urban <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who are looking at something beyond <unk> <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of city is the opportunity for jobs, well-being, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffer from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people living in cities are going to be under 18 years.
If we do not include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to violence -- to be the story of cities.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of young people is <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They don't do pretty much anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital Hospital the hospital where I was born.
I remember being in that hospital hospital thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I'd been forced to be in that same <unk> of <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor some leaders on a business hormone.
They went to about 90 juvenile leaders <unk>
We sat down and we had some rain of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There were no job, no opportunities.
I remember when he told me when he was a graduate graduate student, frustrated, was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest hurdle for the point A to the B are the streets.
<unk> years of civil war, have completely destroyed the traffic system and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and the <unk>
It started a <unk> company.
It started <unk> <unk> to local residents who would not normally afford it.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story do?
I think that his ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the business spirit and I think the spirit spirit may be the most powerful tool against <unk>
They teach young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so long.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some young people at the height of business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business initiative and how to create a culture of business initiative to be discovered.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were plastic sent from abroad.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer is, <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design.
He created a farm outside of <unk> and started growing <unk> and <unk> who he said, could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for wedding -- creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies -- and now it's working in the creation of the first public park in 22 years.
There is no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where the families, the young people, can go together, and as he says, smell pink <unk>
By the way, he doesn't cultivate pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on the young.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their history, their technology, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at his city as a place of opportunity.
encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that might be <unk> of the change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They sell business solutions for local problems.
So, to inspire young people and create a culture of business spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and guidance to <unk> in development and <unk>
They need the young people with the resources they need, <unk> the support they need to move from understanding of the creation to creation, and create the <unk> for urban growth.
For me, business spirit is something else to start a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed not just by selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His <unk> that's how they call it as it is called, when it's created, and it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired children from the street to help rent and keep the motorcycles for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape from paralysis of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs have a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eating their innovation <unk> and you have more stories about flowers and Parks of Peace that <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains -- a <unk> area north of the state of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be on the way that we could <unk> almost we can pretend we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful lake.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts -- <unk> balls of <unk> and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to pull out what they thought they thought was going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed with me, and he was getting a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how to <unk> or where you get the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York, the <unk> Department of <unk> is the <unk> of 11 tons of waste and two tons of <unk> products, every day.
I wanted to know as individuals.
I wanted to understand who that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked through his pathways, and I interviewed people in office office and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed a lot more.
So I started working like <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in my trucks. I don't just travel in my trucks.
And <unk> the mechanical <unk> and <unk> the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as glamorous as you believe, and in the days in which it is very strong one <unk>
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies continued to get the weight of taking over their body tons of garbage every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> waste is one of the most dangerous <unk> of the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and getting into traffic all the day and go through all of you.
They just want to <unk> so generally the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also the garbage itself is filled with dangers that often fall in the truck and cause terrible harm.
I also learned about the relentless trash.
When you get out of the <unk> you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the garbage is as a force of nature itself.
It never leaves coming.
It's also like a breathing or circulation.
It must always be in motion.
And it's also stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the waste waste is the most important workforce on the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of the efficient and effective way every day, this starts to get rid of their <unk> and their dangers are inherent in real ways.
How we had <unk> and centuries they come back and start <unk>
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old we don't have space for what the motors of the economy begin to fail when it's endangered the consumption of the economy.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just pointing your relationship.
And then there's what I call our average speed as we need a daily basis.
And with that I mean just at the speed that we used to move used in <unk>
We usually don't get <unk> or cleaned up or we have our coffee cup of coffee, our bag of water.
We use them -- the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there's a work force on the other side that it takes out of it.
So today I want to suggest today a couple of ways of thinking about waste of waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and focus on that conversation about how to design a sustainable city and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when they <unk>
And their work allows us to make us.
It's almost a way of relief.
The flow that keeps us safe from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a load of waste in the street, grabbed my little child, and I went down the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing a piece of paper paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started to cry.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay."
Shortly after that, I began to research garbage collection and I went back to that man.
It's called <unk> we work together a lot of times, and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and have in account every cost -- even the very actual human cost of labor.
The city waste that we think about when we talk about waste, represent three percent of the <unk> of the nation.
This is a remarkable statistic to it.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next thing to see someone whose job is to clean up the garbage of you, let's give it a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you very much.
My work is focused on a connection to think of our communal life, forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from the conditions and local traditions.
I brought today two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
And they share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center, in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa <unk>
This is the kind of construction that we showed us as example, my team and me, about what we had to design.
At the beginning, the first thing I thought was, "I want to get <unk>
After some of these buildings there are many of these buildings in the city -- we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because the lining of the crystals is generating heat in the inside, so it takes a lot of <unk>
In a city in which this shouldn't happen because it is an temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees in the entire year.
And third, what you see has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiopia.
It's a shame for a place that rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really captivated in the old market that is this open <unk> structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate foreign activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how do we build a <unk> building, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the location of the site, which is located in a lot of growth in the city, where a lot of the buildings that we see in the image, don't exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets, putting all the <unk> of the building.
And this spreads with a <unk> <unk> which creates an outdoor space in the building that is <unk> by its own way of the sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes in every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that we would bring to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue to a concrete shell, with <unk> to allow the air, and also from the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we get inspiration from these beautiful buttons from the dresses <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me to model it.
We're building that with these little pieces of <unk> which are the windows that leave the air and light in a way inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little <unk> crystals that use the light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas it wasn't easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial mall. It wasn't what you want.
But ultimately we all realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the commercial center because ultimately there were more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not just because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air <unk>
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where the electricity is cut almost every day.
So we get a big advantage by putting on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the ceiling as a new public space with gathering areas that would create this urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, which actually collect water for the <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor.
The second example is a master master plan for the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a big project, the bigger that I have designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I set special attention to the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a dozen <unk> gates by near straight lines.
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was to expand the streets and create 12 initial initial blocks in size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some strategic points in relation to the idea of the <unk> doors with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the tiny cell cell -- like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilated, as a natural ventilated, as a natural cycle.
So I <unk> a framework that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant, we have all the connections to <unk>
And it also responds to local norms that set a higher density at higher levels and a lower density in the lower plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back.
It's where all the neighbors, can go up and <unk> and do activities like running a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from a building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes local communities and local economies at the same rate as the buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that they improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have to connect nature to the people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was so remarkable, as you see every new girls.
He had very bright amounts of hair, very bright and a little <unk> <unk> <unk> it was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I had my sinister plan.
One day I stayed a time after the <unk> I was a little afternoon, and I hid in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was <unk> out, I walked in the classroom, I took off my master's table at the Easter table.
And then I did.
I put the ratings on my <unk> just a little bit, just some of these.
All the Like this.  And I set up to return to the book to <unk> but to see, some of my other fellow colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
And I put all rows in <unk> and myself a row of it, just because I would be there, because I <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that it was all <unk>
I never <unk>
But most of all, I would tell me the reason why I really bothered this little little girl, so small, it was so good for you."
I am <unk>
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also those primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that the <unk> are the number one cause of children.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> you know, or the long duration or the sadness.
So that's why you have to go to the fiction, because the novels is like the lab where we study them in all of their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no jealousy, <unk> I would have no literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> wouldn't have <unk>
No king <unk> no king and a <unk>
I wouldn't have Shakespeare.
I read the lists of reading with high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> no <unk> We were <unk> from <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
There is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the mailbox that I have all of them.
This year, it's 100 years of his masterpiece, "In search of time, the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> of mine, all we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forget about how relentless it is.
I mean, it's books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk>
I don't know how the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be obvious as the jealousy, that you get down to the person, to their wish, their <unk> are a good narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel margin, we have a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel bad.
Being a storytellers and the audience, we know exactly what details of the <unk> to put the knife on the knife -- right?
The <unk> make all of them <unk> and that's something that I figured out understood.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure I could treat other pleasure maybe right now."
And it starts to say that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh <unk> that he <unk> he picks his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to acknowledge that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion, emotion -- you have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the great amounts of bright hair and the cute little little bit of <unk>
The <unk> got rid of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links well language <unk> with jealousy.
When <unk> is in his agony of anger, suddenly, listening to the <unk> doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then defending those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "These scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge, search for the truth, a real painful. In fact, what they <unk> <unk> the more painful the best.
The pain, the <unk> These were the <unk> <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need to do, that makes us suffer, it causes us a lot of more profound feelings of feelings and vital that a wise man who can tell us.
We're saying that we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> will reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
There's some other emotion to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud visited by a young woman who was being used with the idea that her woman was <unk>
And Freud said that there was something bizarre in that man, who didn't get sick in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under <unk> without any cause.
But he was looking for things that his wife, <unk> <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or even accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious her wife.
The novels is very good at this.
<unk> describe very well how the <unk> are doing with intensity but no precision.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to do violent or illegal or illegal or illegal or illegal or illegal <unk>
<unk> are driving us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me at the age of eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard about news.
A woman of Michigan for 52 years of age was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook from which they were sending horrible messages to himself, for a year.
For one year, every year.
She was trying to join the new girlfriend of his former <unk> <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How big -- even though creativity, right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel of Patricia <unk>
<unk> one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try and how the jealousy, <unk> our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want to want what you have to get out of your self and <unk> what you ever have to do, and it's under the floor -- <unk> your <unk> your rings, empty your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all over the world, as long as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we're good at social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not sure, when you're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> Street <unk> and ask <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think of <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I have always amazing <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of rat <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius but it really bothers it.
<unk> I sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs your help, but it <unk> it and <unk> with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But how do they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once you go in, <unk> <unk> to everybody with their solution, <unk> <unk> <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says there's no one person in <unk> <unk> who didn't want to hold your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. I find this very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to be treated as a problem of geometry, without excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute are the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> you can admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if the <unk> are really an geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to share it from the greatness in the other.
We can engage with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that that happens, we remember that we have fiction for <unk>
Just fiction fiction, jealousy.
The fiction used to the <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> sweet <unk> <unk> Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> <unk> of Apollo 11 and landed on the Beaufort Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were all alone, but their presence in the surface of the surface of the <unk> was the culmination of a collective <unk>
The Apollo program was the largest system of peace in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave up about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
They died, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked on his surface, of which she was born after the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you <unk>
They didn't make a lot of <unk> <unk> kilos of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the face of Kennedy at Rice University in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> some ask, why do you <unk>
Why do you turn it into our goal?
And you might also ask, why will we climb the most <unk>
35 years ago, why fly on the <unk>
Why does Rice against <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're difficult.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> Apollo wasn't just a victory of the West on the east of the Cold War.
In the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
They were because it was something great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon occurred in a context of a long, technological list.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, <unk> <unk> and eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the story of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a boat with candle -- but in 1969, the Apollo crew of Apollo 10 <unk>
Since 1970s, no human being got back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the <unk> crew of Apollo 10, and the joyful optimism about the power of technology has been challenged by seeing that problems that we imagine that technology would solve how to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or to feed the world population appear to be able to cure <unk>
I remember <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I was five years old, and my mother told me that they didn't hold the <unk> tube <unk> rocket <unk>
I knew vague that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was completely sure I would see colonies on Mars.
So that "Anything it occurred to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear this all the time.
We've heard this for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists had distracted us and had enriched toys, things like <unk> and social networks, and the algorithms that speed up <unk> <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation for the Silicon Valley in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have been created by the least ambitious companies that <unk> from the years in which they were <unk> at Microsoft, Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley is the markets are the <unk> in particular, incentives that venture capitalists offer the entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley led the risk of risk caused by creation of ideas that were <unk> for the funding for problems -- or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying about the risk, they were able to do small investment investment, case that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always been problems to invest with profit in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and whose development is in the long term.
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose not to solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We won't go to Mars because everybody thinks that there are more important things than to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because the political systems fail.
Less than two percent of the global energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar power and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
coal and natural gas is cheaper than solar and wind, and the oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy that can compete in price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties <unk> the development of an enhanced energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and energy development, and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we will see an energy policy of America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technological, they're not to be.
We know for the time that famines are result of failure in the supply of food.
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are political crisis affecting the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for storage and storage of food, but there will be massive and governments.
Finally, the big problems we sometimes have a solution because we don't really understand the problem.
The president Nixon did the war on the cancer war in 1971, but we soon found that there are many kinds of cancer, a lot of <unk> of treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to be found effective and viable.
The hard problems are difficult.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can have and we have -- but these four elements have been <unk> Political leaders and the population must want to be solved by the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it must be really a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like this as a metaphor for the ability for technology to solve big problems, lies with those bill.
But it's a model that is <unk> in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy -- <unk> difficult and dangerous, and there is no popular mythology of science fiction like the way to explore the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, it wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows not the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to begin to start with the ideas that have about trust.
They're so common that have become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a huge decline of trust, it's a very general deal.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third one is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task has been wrong with it.
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a clearest idea about the subject.
First of all, why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I bow to you to think that there may be <unk> in some activities or the institutions and that could have risen in others.
I don't have that clear.
But I can look at surveys and opinion surveys are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at surveys of opinion over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, they continue to <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they continue to be quite <unk> and the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half of the road.
But this is enough evidence.
What conservation polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you <unk>
What you see is the attitudes that people exist when they were doing certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone would tell you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in <unk>
<unk> in the teachers of <unk>
I probably <unk> by asking, "What do you do?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you've got answered your question, "Well, I trust some of them, but in other not."
It's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to put trust in <unk>
We don't assume that the level of confidence that we're going to feel for a certain kind of official official or type is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, to say I trust a certain elementary teacher that I know to give the reading class -- but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we have the evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we left all of that knowledge when we think about trust in the more unequal way.
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they're trying to <unk> the good inherent trial to actually trust something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
I think it's a stupid.
That's not that goal I <unk>
I will encourage you to have more confidence in what's <unk> of trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm <unk> of not trusting what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who are taking their savings with the very <unk> named Mr. <unk> that then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> for intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you tell it, he says, yeah, yeah, it means that what matters in the first room is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about is making a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find a person is <unk> in the <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worth confidence.
But if, on the contrary, they're not allowed to not trust them.
I have friends who are competent and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they would take their own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are being competent and responsible but extremely <unk>
If this is not that I've never been <unk>
But that's what we're going to do is that we are <unk>
<unk> is the answer.
The <unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've tried to build systems of accountability for all kinds of institutions, professional officials and so on, that made us easier for us to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as <unk>
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see, the problem is it takes more time to make the comfort <unk> that I would be going to run away.
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and <unk> that the accountability system that is destined to ensure the <unk> <unk> and testing testing is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks, like <unk> <unk> that we <unk> the <unk> as we say.
I'm sure all of you know similar examples.
And we get all of that, for the target.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if you get to be worthy of trust, and you give people that we are reliable and whether to try to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are trustworthy.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple action, the <unk> which is not doing properly.
Third, the task.
You get the job to rebuild the trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But the confidence in the end, it's kind of signature because they give us a <unk>
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them enough enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> by all people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to add <unk> evidence that you're worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That goes every day, everywhere, it makes the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks from my socks to say I can <unk> without giving explanations to.
I take them and get me back my money, or they change the color I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they become vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So in the end, I think what we're pointing at is not very difficult to <unk>
What people rely on is in relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of computers we've been <unk> to reduce the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been increasingly <unk> more and more and more, at least one millimeter, the thickness of the glass of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I hadn't been <unk>
I started imagining how to <unk>
I first created this tool that gets butt into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers its physical body to the pixel body.
The designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs.
So with this tool.
But the two hands still stay out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with the digital information using all the dexterity of your hands?
In the division of Science at Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
They would take a transparent bombsight with depth cameras to detect the fingers and the face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, getting inside of the space of space 3D and grab the pixels directly with your hands.
Like the windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> is so easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and highlight lines or words with the virtual touch sensor, which is below every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with your hands.
In these examples, we were <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come to us?
<unk> many of us will have bought and go through things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a <unk> device or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this extra idea, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make physical physicists so we could be able to <unk> and <unk>
How would you be a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Hiroshi
This liminal magnet is behaving as a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere within this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> and <unk> mechanical <unk>
And by programming the object, we release the object, we release it from time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back and stay for the physical world.
You can teach physically <unk> and the very famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can replicate it as a physical reality that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physics, and, unlike the monitors or the textbooks -- this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel. It's very powerful.
But what it is more fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show you something but to start acting directly on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without our world.
We started talking about a barrier, but if you <unk> that barrier, the only frontier that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was excited to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the years.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for athletes with all the <unk>
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they believed that there was just an effective path to <unk> a safe job, and <unk>
No matter whether job would like or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera, as well.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
One opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to opera school.
I wrote to the director of the school and the speaker of a radio show.
But no adult would hold the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
All of my friends were <unk> but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was already too much <unk>
My dream is never <unk>
I think for the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> OK.
They went to the books.
<unk> <unk>
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about American <unk>
And it's not propaganda a convenience.
The Bible is interesting, but weird stuff.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment of me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I told me, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> guilt trap, and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also led to my reading <unk>
We have a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning of this map, I thought it was from place because this map is what students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map means the perspective of people.
<unk> reading isn't something new.
It's common practice in the academic world.
There are all sorts of research as a comparative religion and literature <unk>
<unk> and <unk> offers academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if reading comparative work worked for research, why not do it also in life <unk>
So I started reading books.
They may be <unk> <unk> of Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> the <unk> are economic and <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk>
If you know another language, it's fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path from <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> on the road -- Alan <unk> Instead of lost in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation of which I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> mother."
Books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel like I used to feel like ever.
Having a broken dream, it's really not compared to what a lot of others have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, of where the passion, where your happiness.
Until a broken dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, that I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client of <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> dropped on the couch from my office and took off the shoes and said he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My fellow roommate had a <unk> like the first client.
And I got a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought it could go.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it made me easy for me just to move your head as I was doing the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> and I was saying Alex, and so I was right.
You start to work after that, then you have children later on, until death happens later.
For <unk> as Alex and I had <unk>
But shortly after, my squad squad <unk> <unk> me to press Alex who would talk about his life.
I was hooked.
I said, "Sure, he's coming out with guys under your category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my cousin said, he said, "No, no, but maybe she <unk> with the other.
In addition, the best time to work in Alex marriage is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they were <unk> but this didn't make the footsteps of Alex being a pause in their development.
This was what it did was the perfect moment of Alex were the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And so I realized, that this kind of Lakota hospitality was a real problem and it had real, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future of <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that no one comes to adulthood without going to happen before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing. They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> they love a dream -- I want to see. It's good. <unk> the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will be spent at 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments of <unk> that give your life will have happened for when you're 30 and <unk>
People of the 40, you don't panic.
This audience is going to be okay, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we have.
We know more than half of Americans are married, they live or they're coming out with their future partner.
We know that the brain ends up the second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and they are <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something that wants to change from themselves, now it's the time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than any other time in life, and we know that female fertility comes to its top to the 28 and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the time to protect them over their body and their choices.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years is crucial to language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which her everyday and common life has an impact on the person who <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in the adult development.
But this is not what they're listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the timeline.
The researchers call the <unk> an <unk>
The journalists name them names, names.
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard <unk> said to make great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think that happens when you give you another <unk> on your head and you say, "You get another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and her ambition and nothing happens absolutely nothing.
And then every day, the intelligent, interesting people like you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship.
Or they say, "Everybody says that as you start a career before 30, everything being okay."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are in <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better copy the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My dates during the <unk> were like the game play.
They were all running, all running, but then at some point around the 30, it turned out the music and everybody began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who would be standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the closest chair when I had <unk>
Where are the <unk>
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit extreme -- but it doesn't be <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure on the <unk> and so many of you start a career, to choose a city, choosing a couple, and have two or three children in a much more short time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are some research that you start to show, which is a lot harder and miserable to do everything from once to <unk>
The middle class crisis is not about buying red red cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
You see, you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> look at themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
By 25, Emma came to my office because she was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said he would like to work in art or the entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living in a very difficult time, his earlier life had been even more difficult.
They were often in our <unk> but then she woke up her same way, "You don't choose her family, but she can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost the entire hour.
He had just bought a new book for <unk> and I had spent the entire morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he was watching the empty space that follows after the words "In <unk> please call <unk>
I was at the point of <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of whether it gives me <unk>
At that time, it took a lot of work to resist and I wouldn't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was her opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as I worked with Alex as I was sitting while the <unk> <unk>
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that every man or woman, she deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who gets rid of that identity crisis and the identity of identity.
For identity capital, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that's an investment in what you want to be after.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I do know this: This identity capital makes you identity.
So now it's the time for that work on the other side of the country, of that company that you want to give a try.
I'm not <unk> The exploration, I am <unk> the exploration that we shouldn't count, by the way, it's not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I told Emma that would explore jobs and make them count.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you at the airport, but the ones that come together with friends with friends with similar minds are limited when you know who you know how they think about, how they think, how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who is going to get out almost always comes out of the <unk>
The new things come from what they're called a weak <unk> friends of friends of friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> they have a bad job or not work.
But the other half won't, and the weak links are the way we get into this group.
Half of the jobs that I created is never <unk> then knowing the head of your neighbor is how you get a job to get a job out there.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For the end, but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose her family, but I know her friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma would soon serve his family when he has a partner and in her own family.
I told Emma the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think 30 is better age to sit at my head than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choice to the person who you live now or <unk> now when everyone on Facebook are starting to walk into <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means being so intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice from who and what they want instead of just doing it is going to work or kill time with anyone who is that you would blame you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the roommate in a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a job there.
That work supply was a reason to leave the boyfriend with the living room.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special of events in museums.
This married a man who elected <unk>
They love her new career, he loves her new family, and I send me a letter to say, "Now the spaces of emergency contacts are not <unk> enough.
The story of Emma can sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like planes coming out of the airport from Los Angeles, who go somewhere in the west.
Just before the <unk> a slight <unk> in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or 25 or even the <unk> a good conversation, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few or even the next generations.
Here's my idea worth spreading all the <unk>
It's as simple as I learned to tell <unk>
It's what I now have the privilege of telling <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get identity, you get identity capital -- using their weak ties.
Don't be defined by what they didn't know or what they didn't.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job in management management for a job that was even more <unk> <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics for seventh degree in New York schools.
And as any teacher, I applied tests and tests.
I gave them assignments.
When the job comes back, I was grades.
What struck me is that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the ones who had a better performance have scores <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure better ways.
It's the <unk> but what if you succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of scenarios. And in every study, my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
And we tried to predict what would happen in military training and who <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what kids are going to do as much as possible at competition.
We studied professors who are working in the very hard neighborhoods -- so what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school and to <unk> who will be the most effective to improve the outcomes of the learning of their <unk>
We partnered with private enterprises, asking you, what about these vendors are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts, it came up with characteristic as a significant success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health, and it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and perseverance to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is having a resistance.
<unk> clinging to his future day after day, not only for a week, not only for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> to live life as if it was a <unk> not a race at all.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my items of determination and then waited about over a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly greater determination -- even though the <unk> in every aspect that I could measure, things like the family income, the results of testing -- even the security that they felt kids when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> is in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is how little we know, how little people know about development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you develop the determination in the kids?
What do I have to do to teach kids a robust job?
How do I keep them for the long <unk>
The more honest answer is: I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who are just not following their <unk>
In fact, in our data, our determination is commonly related to or it's even related to the talent operations.
Up until now, the best idea I've ever heard about developing purpose in children is something called <unk>
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure if you've been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start all over again with the lessons.
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that anyone who is that you want to understand and appreciating the beauty of this sophisticated language.
I started thinking about how a new and quick method of learning Chinese might be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic <unk>
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of basic literature, long enough to read traffic signals <unk> <unk> to understand the basic idea of the websites or the newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as possible until it's <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a <unk>
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms in both sides, as if I were screaming <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> this symbol is actually <unk> from the form of called, but I like to believe it is in the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of gates of a <unk> in the old west West.
I call <unk> to these eight characters.
They're building blocks for them to create a lot more characters.
One person.
If somebody walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, <unk> two are company, three are crowd.
If a person stretch your arms, this person is saying <unk> this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree, two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> to remember, because a tree loudspeaker is quite an idiot.
Remember the fire?
Two together, it becomes very hot.
Three together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon, bright together, that's the <unk>
It also means morning, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door. Put a table inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> married someone at home?
This person is coming out of hidden from a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, they're <unk>
So we've already spent nearly 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every small effort, you will be able to learn a couple of characters, which is the same thing that you learn a Chinese Chinese.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun.
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is in China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we created Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains hanging over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese <unk> are going to get their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a result.
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film took his imagination for months for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a bright dress and bring a magic wand on it.
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand which it's an extraordinary thing.
We now live and we raised our children in a sort of industrial complex of <unk>
However, the magician magician, was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took 40 years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> and a <unk> boy and a <unk> boy would <unk> a girl dressed as a <unk>
You know what I'm talking about?  Yes.
There's a huge difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician magician, and all the movies we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like the <unk>
But I think if the magician magician is done today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
They had magical shoes to defeat the armies generated by the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the magician magician, is that the most creative characters and wise characters are even women.
I began to notice this when I was watching "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a son.
three years old.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the surveillance level had been <unk>  So, she slid in the room and was struck by a mom and was stuck with her <unk> and I don't think he understood what was going on, but I didn't think he understood what was going on.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be issues of value, resilience and <unk>
I would have the sense that Luke get an army to launch the government?
This is the magician of <unk>
How does he win Dorothy his film?
They do good <unk> with all of us and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow up to grow out, OK?
Why is there so much 40,000 pounds in the movies for our children, and so little on the road of <unk>
There's a lot of literature on the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that Princess <unk> doesn't give you the proper framework that I had served to navigate around the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time the first kiss really hoped that the credits of the movie, right?
My quest is finished, I have a girlfriend.
Why do you stay there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like if it's a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are lots of exceptions, and to defend the <unk> of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to the children, even though them, they are not really their target audience.
They make a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to fight the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how they defend from the <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have a few great women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being a war movies.
Of course, the most successful theme of all times continues to come up in classic after classic each one of them on the adventure of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are raising a little girl.
until, as many of you are thinking, this year, this year, finally came out.
I recommend all of you, it's already available in stores.
Do you remember what the criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that do that.
Well, almost none of these films the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not <unk> and it's already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a book of comics, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that I had with a friend on the assessment of the movies they saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions you need to do, in the movie, there is more of a female character to have lines?
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more besides the kid you like it?  Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women that exist and they talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet very rarely I see it in the cinema that we know and we love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality movie.
Right? <unk>
<unk> not the <unk> test.
And I don't think <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen a lot of the movie in a embassy where men and women are hiding during the <unk> crisis.
We have lots of scenes of men who have profound and painful and painful and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> the bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's put it into the numbers.
In 2011, of the most popular movies how many of them believe they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women that we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's okay.
But there's a bigger number that this one is going to take this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, <unk>
One in the United States, one in five women said it's been sexually assaulted in their life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think music music or pornography are closely <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is there is a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do you not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says the role of a male hero is to defeat <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very startling statistic and we want to take it out.
We have tools to our willingness like <unk> <unk> and we hope that that would happen, but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> whether at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our kids to keep their power to go.
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way of doing something really important, and here I mean mainly to the parents.
I think we need to show our male children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of masculinity is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the <unk> and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite <unk> character of "Star <unk> Do you know what you want.
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant legs.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that they know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them achieve their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories where I tell my <unk> Go and struggle just and more stories where you see your job is to join a team -- maybe a team led by women, helping other people better and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine and one of the things I liked to do was look for fortune cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would give me lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered with sand and it's hard to see them.
And yet, over time, I was invited to <unk>
I began to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and an <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of five miles of length along with <unk>
And my sea biscuits had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try and make a map of the past, I knew I had to do it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see by using the <unk>
This is a place in the eastern <unk> Delta called <unk>
And the place, in the naked eye, seems to be a brown, but when we use infrared and we process it using false color suddenly the place looks like pink pink <unk>
What you're looking at is the actual chemical changes of the landscape by building materials and activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find an old American city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Empire Empire roughly 4,000 years ago.
The place is located in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Ottoman Empire there was this great renaissance of the ancient art of art, architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that the <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere within this massive <unk> of <unk>
This area is enormous -- it's about <unk> by <unk> feet.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved through this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find out of the randomness, it would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes <unk> and using baseball.
So we use NASA data from NASA to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
So we were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly high area that looks inside the circle here, that we think could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians by doing <unk> jobs you can see here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of it in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, underneath a thick thick layer of mud, we find a dense layer of objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a layer of occupation for several hundred years coming back from the Middle Empire exactly the same period we think it's <unk>
We also find jobs of <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like not a lot, but when we think of the most common stones were used in the jewelry, of the Middle Empire, these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that goes from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence from a elite jewelry, which shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but you can go to the place in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end my favorite quote from the Middle Empire probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
To share knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on land.
So according to TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the real ideas really started in 1984 B.C. in a lost city, not for a long time and found from the high.
It certainly puts the pursuit of <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk>
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now I would take a group of <unk> <unk> in bicycles.
They are racing on a race and <unk> and they're going in direction to their entrance door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide against the door of your house.
There are bicycles flying everywhere, wheels that go on their side, rays of the wheels that end up in <unk> <unk> the threshold line.
In the lobby, or what the other side of the door, and watch the quality of the light, the light shining on the <unk> of <unk>
It's waving with your hand.
From his chair on a brown horse,
It's a horse which is talking about.
You can feel your blue <unk> hitting your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you can go to the mouth <unk>
They went through one side and enter his living room.
It's already in the room, and doing the most use of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, clothes, dancing on his car <unk> singing <unk> One More More <unk>
Now I went to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow brick path from the oven and from the oven coming towards you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> of the United States."
I was going to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, <unk> I guess, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few ladies of different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were looking at hundreds of numbers looking at them just once.
They put the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
I would describe whole poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize <unk> the order of a deck of <unk>
And I thought, "This is <unk>
These people must be <unk>
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and has one of the best memories of <unk>
I said, <unk> when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have average memory.
All of those who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
We said, "We have trained to perform these miraculous memory acts by using old techniques to invented 2,500 years ago in Greece, the same techniques that we used <unk> to memorize their narratives -- and that academics were using them to memorize books <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have heard of this <unk>
We were standing out of the classroom of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and bright English, although a little bit <unk> he said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
Do you know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of cards in a deck, on national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me.
I mean, you have to start something wrong.
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why it doesn't work and what its potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
Their memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a <unk> problem is awesome.
Somebody incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see how much our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this guy.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We went back in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> guides <unk> was <unk>
And by coming back, I read a number of treaties on the memory written something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having disciplined and disciplined memory was not a thing as rare as it might be like today.
A long time, people invest in their memory, in providing <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but we've also changed us.
We have changed, and I would say we have changed the cognitive system.
We have almost no need to remember, sometimes it seems like we've forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where are you still passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this very unique competition of memory.
It's not really so <unk> there is <unk> like this around the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at University College London invited a memory game group to the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it going to be able to have brains in some structural way, or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are you smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test battery -- and the answer was actually not.
And there was a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them in an MRI machine, they will break their brains as we were <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> found that in memory champions were <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or they looked like a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> <unk> is driving as a arms race where each year comes out with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times memory player.
In his desk, in front of him, there is 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> that he is about trying to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and that he was invented.
He used a similar technique to memorize the order of <unk> digits <unk>
Half an hour. Yeah.
And as there is a huge amount of ways of remembering things in these holes, absolutely all the techniques used at the end of the last single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> <unk> <unk> says this: I say to two people who remember the same word. I tell you -- there's a man called <unk>
That's your <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> that there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later on, and I ask them to tell them that word I told you a <unk>
Do you know what <unk>
The person who was told that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was said to her work is <unk>
Same word, different capacity, that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything for you. It doesn't have any relationship.
With all the other memories that dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They wear white hats.
They have <unk> in hands.
They worked well when they come home to work.
You probably have some <unk>
And when I first put that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point later.
One of the more elaborate techniques to do this back and a half thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> who went to a <unk>
They had been hired as a entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't bring a <unk> it was <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up, he stood up his memory poem, and he was <unk> and so soon he was the room of the <unk> <unk>
Tell them all.
But it was not only killed everyone, but it shattered the bodies of <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, no one could remember where they were sitting.
And so they could not be able to take it off the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
He was standing outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, shut down the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting on each other.
He took the family of the hand <unk> where they were their loved ones in the rubble.
What <unk> <unk> at that time is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we're not good at remembering names or phone numbers or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and exceptional spatial memory.
If I asked them to tell me, the first 10 words of the story I've just told you about <unk> is very likely to be able to do it.
But I would bet if you ask them to tell you who sitting on the horse speaker in his lobby, they would be able to be <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of his mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember the <unk> the <unk> idea, the <unk> idea, and <unk> -- it's the image, more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, the first full of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it from the same way that I would have made it <unk> if you had been invited to <unk> it 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine you are at the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image, crazy and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing they want to mention is that <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine looking at your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> on Mister <unk>
And that would remind you they want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then in the kitchen, and the fourth topic that they would talk about would be that strange journey that made for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
This is how the speakers <unk> <unk> their narratives -- not a word for word, which is going to confuse it but typical of typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a remnant of when people thought about <unk> and all the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first <unk> would be like the first place in your memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I packed with it full of it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a boring event, boring.
So seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting tests. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets broken up the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning before I sat at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient <unk> school bought in a market <unk>
And I discovered that this was very entertaining.
I would never have expected you to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just to train memory.
What is actually about doing is to better improve the ability to create and imagine these images, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was really hooked on this.
This is me, using my standard team of training for memory competition.
This is a couple of <unk> and a security seat covered with tape leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before, and he had the idea that I could put in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be able to memorize narratives and phone phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just tricks. They work.
Because they are based on pretty basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to build <unk> of memory or memorize <unk> to profit with a little bit of insight on how their mind.
We often talk about people with a big memory as if it was about a <unk> <unk> but it's not the case.
The big memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deeply.
The palace of <unk> these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
It will be a kind of profound processing, a kind of a complete attention that most is not going on <unk> out there.
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today, that's what I did -- the <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short <unk> <unk> in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks into our side. Will we be so <unk> that we don't even believe in processing in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are amazing memory abilities.
But if you want to live a living, you have to be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so you can take just a <unk> <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I was living there in my parents' home in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom to share with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the restroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there everybody was going through the TV show, so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, everybody was looking at me and every time I <unk> and I got back in a towel, everybody was seen.
And I was like that.
It was <unk> insecure and hated it.
I hated that tour, I hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, not of the culture, but of those emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's no wonder that we feel that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency --  -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
So 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
So this means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you want, think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it by based on a building and 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> which uses architects to create an emotional connection to the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, we used it to build houses.
See, these <unk> <unk> <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is really, really useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time, and it's very complicated.
The people who <unk> the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways they know they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> which was ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, he has a <unk> it has this green thing, and he has this red thing, and they leave <unk> what <unk> tries to communicate with this <unk> the children, the values of property, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, was finished another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to discover and to share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, two buildings, they're both called <unk>
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of the <unk>
On one side there is the <unk> architects that are constantly driving new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for life today.
We gave it and we gave it so much, we gave it so much, we were out of the people.
And all of the black, this is <unk> you think we feel very well, but we're dead because we don't have another option.
We need to go to the other side and go back with those symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we start to experiment with <unk> we make the curve back to go ahead and over and over again, and we've done it over the last 30 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, <unk> of the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with so-called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
So you can guess.
<unk> small, on a <unk> scale.
Something really really hard.
So we get closer to the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
We put it back in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that we like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added bake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we turned them into a skyscraper, which can be <unk> <unk>
The shapes are <unk> won in boldness and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
Kind of.
But the '80s, that was great.
We all spend the business centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to the French or to the Italian one.
You may have a little bit of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, they're easy, because instead of creating new spaces, we create memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started making a swing on the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now have new design techniques in a computer, and we find ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that <unk> against other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You're totally <unk>
Typically, the <unk> <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then, something else happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said Bilbao was one of those rare moments when we were critical and public and public in general, completely agreed about a building.
The New York Times <unk> this <unk> <unk>
The tourism in Bilbao went up to two and a half and the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Chicago, Chicago, New York, Cleveland,
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first <unk>
But how is it possible that these <unk> wild and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media gets <unk> around them and quickly learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
Same thing did the main mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon in the beginning of the new millennium, with other architects star.
I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects at the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to happen with all the architecture.
Imagine, for example, how we use architecture.
A thousand years ago, you would have to walked up to the next town to see a building.
The transportation is <unk> they can take a boat, an airplane, can you be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and at the end, we are all photographers from architecture, and the building is carried beyond their physical place.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so quickly.
It doesn't look a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings -- before you know whether that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a two-year <unk> movement.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much <unk>
That's never going to happen to happen, because we're at the biggest threshold threshold in architecture from the invention of the <unk> of the <unk> or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the media, it starts to swing faster and faster, until it's going to be in both extremes almost in <unk> and it's effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you are the public.
Now we can make a <unk> symbols of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works, in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly like the product done, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people began to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being just a building, it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, they are the images that you made of the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory and to charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think of a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first of course, <unk> the Internet for <unk> <unk>
They were bombarded with examples of <unk> innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can take the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell you that there is no unique answer to what a library can be a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that are using words of funny words and drawings -- and one is no longer a <unk> audience, who doesn't embrace anything before.
The architects can listen, and you don't stop that by architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> of one style to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find solutions right to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that buildings in the morning will be very different from today's buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn, can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of red brick with a base in ideas of what it should be a <unk>
This means that robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for ways that will produce.
That means that buildings are <unk> to the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking garage garage in Miami Beach, Florida, can also serve for a sport or to <unk> or even you can marry it at night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming in the East Side of New York, and to raise half a million dollars of the community together around that cause, it's no longer a client alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion, of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we build what we build.
The architects already know how to make buildings more <unk> smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you.
And finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because it's a lot of play.
Buildings not only reflect our society, but they shape the <unk> <unk> local libraries where we form our children, and the <unk> of the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it does this very cool of the <unk> of a year, <unk> as if your body was moving too fast for her legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is look in the mirror.
She really loves her <unk>
It <unk> and <unk> and it gives themselves these big <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me I used to do this, and let me think, When did we do this?
How is it that we suddenly are not comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for Google "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, it just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom tells him all the time he is beautiful, every day in school, someone says it's ugly.
And between what her mom tells him and what her friends, or partners in school, they say, "You don't know who to believe.
So a video of her own, he publishes it on YouTube, and asks others to please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, so far, he has gotten over 3,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a healthy healthy teenager, which gets these answers to one of the most important stages of their most emotionally.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's going to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under the pressure of being online and available all the time, talking to you, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we have been so connected in a continuous way, so much young <unk>
As a mother told me, "It's like a party in your room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, of being always connected -- it's <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of likes and the kinds of comments that they do.
There's no division between life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what is rigged digitally.
What is the most of the rest of someone in front of someone in front of you in a context every day?
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news stories now.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk>
<unk> technique is now routine.
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those who <unk> it means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what the young people are doing?
But kids are not immune to this.
Like the <unk> tribal stars, and the singers <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other things begin to be hurt.
Six in 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for its growth as human beings, and how to <unk> society and the labor of the workforce.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the <unk> science debates -- to participate in the classroom debates because they don't want to call attention to their physical <unk>
One in five are not attending classes at all days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the exams, if you don't think you see it good enough, you know, specifically if you don't think you're low enough -- <unk> a lower note at the average of your fellow who don't care about how appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, the U.S. and China.
And it gets regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So in order to be clear, we're talking about how you see it, not what you're really like.
The low self-esteem over your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
teens with little self-esteem is less physical activity, they eat fewer fruits and vegetables, engage in more diet not healthy than they can take them to a food supply.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around them and they're at greater risk of depression.
And we think that's all of this because of what they make more effective decisions like alcohol and alcohol consumption -- diet <unk> aesthetics, sexual relationships of early age and without protection and damage to <unk>
The search for the perfect body is pushing into the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they're overweight again, regardless of whether or they don't have higher rates of <unk>
Fifty percent of women are not presented to an interview interview in one day where they don't feel secure in the way you can see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be <unk>
<unk> this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, for itself, doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key <unk> The first is that we need to instill trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of programs available to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really amazed when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children are not just going to have a positive impact, but also an durable impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key <unk> the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are critical points for any willing to provide an education on body self-esteem that works.
A education is <unk> but tackling this problem requires each of us to take charge on the issue and be a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
defy the current status of the way women are seen and talked about our circles.
It's not good to count on our politicians in <unk> or the size of its <unk> or <unk> that determination or success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people by what they are, not as you can see.
All of us can start by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can tell people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you: When was the last time you put a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, like governments and business, to change our culture, so that our children will grow to be extended to the value of their own, valuing the individuality, the <unk>
We need to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
For making a difference in the real world, let's make them those who come out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that you can never be seen by the <unk> of being who are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your lives.
Who are you in mind?
He <unk>
He <unk>
He <unk>
His <unk>
It could be just the woman who is two seats away. What would mean for her if he was released from that voice <unk> in his interior, that he would be able to take him for not having a long legs, <unk> <unk> a more <unk> feet <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were doing this and we would be able to empower their potential that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images is to inspire us all.
But let's get it to our children the truth.
You know, what you see is just one part of your identity, and the truth is that we love for those who are and why they do, and as they make us feel.
They went to self-esteem in our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to government, so that the small <unk> of a year of today, they become safe and insurance agents in their own tomorrow.
Let's do it.
On the top of November 1990s, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi leader <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
At first, initially they were able to destroy it, but being a prisoner for other ghost charges in others, they started planning attacks on a few dozen New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Luckily those plans was <unk> by an FBI <unk>
Sadly, the bomb bomb in the World Trade Center, couldn't be able to escape it.
Later on, he would be convicted of her participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with a loving mother elementary elementary school teacher.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam -- that very few, even most Muslims, even most Muslims come to know.
For experience I saw that when people take time to interact with, you don't need a lot to want to wish the same things in life.
However, all across religion, in all of the human group, there is always a small fraction of people who were <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that think we need to use all of the possible means so that everyone lived like them.
A few months before he was arrest with me and explained to me that in the last weekends he and some friends had been going to training at Long Island, to practice. Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I touched my father <unk> my father helped me hold my shoulder on my shoulder and explained to me how to point to about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot -- I gave the little orange light on the goal and to surprise me, especially me, the whole goal broke on fire.
My uncle turned to others and Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
From a father, maybe child.
All of all, the comment made a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what they thought was so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned by putting a loaded with 700 pounds of explosives in the north parking parking lot in the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and injured other 1,000.
I admired these men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood, not allowed me to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable close to someone it's already a pack moment and getting to another city.
As I was always the new face of the class that I often was <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white but being the new of the class, quiet and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to put it very <unk> to grow under <unk> I was not prepared for the real world.
I was <unk> <unk> judge people, based on indicators <unk> as their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they tested my way of thinking, was during the presidential election of 2000.
In a <unk> program in which I participated in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, as I had been a victim of <unk> almost my entire life, was something I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids we were doing friendship, was Jewish people.
I took several days to go out of light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud of having been able to defeat the barrier that the whole life was made me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer work in Bush <unk> a <unk> park.
I found myself with people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental to development of my character.
Every life had been taught to me that the <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
So I happened to have the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critics that I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people, exactly the way I wish I wish to be treated.
So I could contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how that is that of being homosexual but I know what it's going to be <unk> for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart made me <unk> honest with my <unk> and I helped me see that the race of people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my own figure -- at a moment that I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother on how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something that keep my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with my eyes tired of someone who has suffered enough <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hate in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break my relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I decided to go out and put me at a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope someone, you want to get to violence, you can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, which although I gave me to this violent revolution and <unk> I didn't get me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and the prejudice.
I do it by the victims of the terrorism and their loved ones, because of the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
For the victims of the terrorism talking against those meaningless acts as rejection of my father's actions.
So with this <unk> I put myself here as proof that violence is not inherent to no religion or race, that children don't have to follow the trails of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.
Right now, there's a film that is projects on their minds.
It's an incredible film, incredible.
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your movie has traces and <unk>
It feels your body, your pain, your hunger, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like your childhood moments that sit in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
<unk> is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie -- you and you and you.
There's nothing to make it more directly.
At least, I know I have an awareness of it.
I don't have certain you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't mindful of mindful -- nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we have to produce to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Science in nature, is objective to nature.
<unk> is <unk> <unk>
So there is never a science of consciousness.
Because during most of the 20th century, that vision.
Now, psychology was studying the pro-social behavior, neuroscience was studying the brain -- but never ever mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientists about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science to make science <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental constraints until the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of fantastic job that presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand a lot better, for example, areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of experience, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain to you to say that this kind of work of neuroscience answers some questions that we want to explain consciousness. So questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what they <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
Not to offend the <unk>
Actually, there's no easy problems with consciousness.
Now, not address the true central mystery of this <unk> why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there a movie internal <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomena like <unk> like life, and we're going to find <unk>
The typical <unk> are all of the emerging behaviors, how they operate the <unk> how they work <unk> how they work out and how <unk> are adapting and <unk> the living organisms all are questions about how it works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as an alternative phenomenon -- how we can talk about it, how we talk, how we play <unk> all of these are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between the easy problems.
But the hard problem, is the question why everything is accompanied by an experience of <unk>
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> of heart.
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I would hit my head against the wall for a theory of pure personal terms that would work.
But at the end of the end, I got to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to focus on this point.
We have a string of wonderful explanations for us, and we get used to this, physics explains chemical chemistry, chemical explains biology, biology explains the psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this <unk>
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to manipulate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think the consciousness, right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate into our worldview, but we don't know even how.
So with an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that are <unk> <unk> before we could deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such hard problem of consciousness.
All of the idea of the internal subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the cognitive functions -- brain behaviors, and this is studies all that needs <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a pure consciousness theory based on the brain.
At the same time, for a lot of others, that vision is pretty close to simply denying that the observation of consciousness is satisfying to be eaten.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time that, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe as bricks -- the core space and the mass.
It makes laws fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of nothing more basic.
Instead, they're considered fundamental -- and that's what the world is constructed.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental list is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> <unk> found that you can't explain electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass law, federal law, and it <unk> the basic charge of the <unk> and <unk> the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those <unk> laws.
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space -- time, mass, that for a matter of logic, you have to list the list.
The most natural would be <unk> consciousness as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens the way to frame scientifically.
So what we need to do is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, laws that connect consciousness to other fundamental concepts -- the space -- the time, the <unk> processes.
<unk> sometimes say we want fundamental laws that could be used by a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can get them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for all, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, your dogs, flies, even the microbes of Rob <unk> even the microbes in Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with heartbreak when I think of God, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But thinking is that perhaps photons can have some kind of crude sense of feeling -- <unk> some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think about that <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is critical.
If it's <unk> like space and time and mass, it's natural to assume it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more about a continuum of nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way to find fundamental laws that will affect the thinking with the physical process, is to embrace the awareness of the information.
There's always that there's information processing -- you have consciousness.
<unk> of complex <unk> as in a human being, a human consciousness, awareness.
<unk> of simple, simple <unk>
Something very exciting is that in recent years a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed the <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a measure of information integration which is called <unk> which measures the level of information integrated into a system.
And I am supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is an average degree of information integration -- just as meaningful, degree of conscious awareness.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration of information is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In the theory, there will still be a different level of consciousness from zero to zero.
It actually <unk> a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate the awareness to the physical world.
The physicists and philosophers have found that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the bottom of the rain
As Stephen Hawking's explains where the fire comes out of the <unk>
From <unk> view, the equations of physics can be left as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts on the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's in the center.
This view -- I think, vision <unk> has the potential for <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can have very serious ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I should not eat anything that was <unk> then should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll be extremely hungry.
I think you know, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of information <unk> she has a complicated piece of information processing it so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, if this is the good ethical problems that are quite serious about the ethic of developing systems of intelligent computers and smart computers and <unk>
Finally, you can ask for your collective consciousness -- the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group, an integrated group, like the audience at a TED Talk, we have a TED collective consciousness -- an internal film for this whole <unk> group of the internal movies of each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question you should take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually most sure about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, that the second thing that is universal.
Vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness, we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go through the right path to a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, it's probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it at night to the morning.
But I think we finally get to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the real key key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, a low education.
I went to school, I joined my friends with my friends, my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to make it for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's a evident.
She has no anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low-budget profile on my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability outside of the equation.
Years later, he was in the second part of teaching school in a high school school, just after about 20 minutes in the class 11 <unk> studies, one boy raised her hand and said, "Hey, when will you give your <unk>
I said, "What?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your speech <unk>
When people in wheels of wheels, they talk about things that would be in school?"
Usually in the classroom.
And it was when I realized, this child had had people with disability people like inspiration.
And we don't. And it's not <unk> I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We are there to inspire me.
And in fact, I am on this stage focusing on what I do in this wheelchair, and you're probably waiting for you. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I fear <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we were in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is something like <unk> A capital <unk>
It's a bad thing and living with a disability that makes you <unk>
It's not a bad thing, and you can't make it <unk>
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more of this lie through social media.
You might have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one, of the girl without the hands drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the <unk> porn term, because we would give a group of people to benefit from another group of people.
And so in this case, we will give the people in a benefit of people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life, it might be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the count of the number of times that have been tackled by strange <unk> expressing that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was happening before my work had a public profile.
It was kind of like I got up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, these images, those images will fill people with disability at benefit from people without disabilities.
They're there for you to see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a difficult thing.
It would make a few things.
But the things that we spend aren't the things that you can think of.
They are not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was called the social model of <unk> which tells us that we are more <unk> because of the society that we live in, because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
What I need to do, and I've learned to take the best of your capacity as well as you do, and that's what happens with the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They're just using their bodies taking their bodies better.
So it's really fair <unk> in the way we do that, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because you've been sold to this lie that disability makes us quite a very exceptional thing.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "My God, <unk> aren't sometimes inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
Some other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't know that I am more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that fall over.  They would take the clever trick of how to charge the mobile phone on your chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that we <unk> and <unk> us.
I really believe that that lie that we have sold us about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad deal, the reason that that's lie is because it's not real, because of the social model of disabilities.
A lot of smiles in front of the stairs hasn't made it become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> to a television screen will not make the <unk> <unk> for <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all of those books into <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl sitting in his room watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not considered to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability to be able to get out of bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child at 11 grade school in Melbourne is not a little surprised that their new teacher is a <unk> user <unk>
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think about to know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do they have to do about augmented reality and professional football with <unk>
And what is the average velocity of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, I'm just going to answer one of those questions, so please, please don't get there.
When people think of reality <unk> thinks of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to learn, because augmented reality change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing <unk> your Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a gadget that allows them to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is a professional surgeon in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to fix it.
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would do with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is running through the <unk> field of 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a young man of 110 pounds -- we were trying to deal with it all its being.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
And I had a few videos to show you what is using Google <unk> under the hull, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of the <unk> practices, because the idea of the <unk> technology is a submarine up up to the surface.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Here we go.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A few times a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what it's going to be <unk> at the football camp from the <unk> perspective.
You may have realized that we need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> of <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more about the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
They want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, be their favorite players and have asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we go to the next <unk>
We took it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many people know about.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality device ever created, and it's not <unk> cheap.
And I'm going to show you why why is this video.
Man: Oh, no.
No, no, no! I don't want to follow <unk> No!
Oh my God! Ah! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on a roller roller coaster for her life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before she was running and making a <unk> Which will be the experience of a fan of it.
When it can be <unk> running through the <unk> throwing the ball off the bottom of the network?  Or <unk> making a stick in <unk>
What will be your experience when you walk away from a mountain to over 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe it was <unk> the <unk> <unk> sales for adults.
But this is not still <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the reality of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality -- <unk> reality when the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use the technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So here's a quick refresher on technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> <unk> they put a <unk> to his field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided <unk>
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> made radios in the <unk> of the countryside and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that you're a player coming back to your group, and you see your next step -- you get shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you put in, you don't have to worry about throwing a <unk>
or to memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose them, they hate to lose games.
If you lose games like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the party.
How would you do?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the high people in the bottom.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is sent to your game.
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad guys will have <unk>
This is <unk> to the good teams of the bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and analysis of data to stop being just for nerds.
It would be also to <unk> Who would have been <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that you are the <unk>
I got the ball and <unk>
<unk> an open receiver -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight -- you would tell you that a defense behind you is going to ignore it, and they don't get it, but the <unk> system will get you.
It takes the protection.
Another <unk> you want you to have an open chain.
You get the <unk> but you <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where the receptor is the bombsight at its bombsight -- an area of grass that lights up and can modify the career.
It <unk> <unk> the <unk> runs and <unk>
The handsome audience and the fans have followed it from every angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion on the party.
I'm going to make lots of people it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, right?
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just like bread and <unk> like our entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, to be in another person.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth of a gay man in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how they live <unk>
How much is a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science rather than <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is close.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face, <unk> as usual, of us.
Thank you.
I recently joined after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years had happened to me the end of the South County of <unk> which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure known for its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its architectural <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer decided to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much <unk>
suicide from the bridge is not practical, or <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped on their death from that bridge.
Some of them believe that travel between the two towers will take you to another dimension, this bridge has <unk> as such, so that every ever from it, it frees you out of all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one every free to five to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks down the bones, some of which <unk> organs.
Most of the impact.
The ones that no, normally <unk> in the water, and then they <unk>
I don't think that those of us who are doing this method of suicide will realize the death of the death <unk>
This is the wire.
Except for about the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel into the bridge.
This is where most people are for before they get their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the most dark time, it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man spoke with an officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back into the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
You can see to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> the suicide, but by the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at July 22 year when they got a call from a possible suicide guy sitting in the signal.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to an Golden Golden <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old, and I had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, he had flown up to here two times before New Jersey to try and get her from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked us if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology -- <unk> <unk> I created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could be more than <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came out <unk> <unk> and all sorts of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> leaned on on the right, and he left.
This kind of kind and clever guy in New Jersey had just taken their life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi rabbi of the family called me to see what I was.
The parents of Jason had the order.
The damage from suicide affects lots of people.
I pose these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it was <unk>
What do you do?
Did you know what to say?
In my experience, not just to talk, but you have to listen to.
Listening to understand.
I don't hear <unk> or say to the person who you know how it feels like because you probably don't know.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think somebody's <unk> you don't have a fear of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is, <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about finishing life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> to the person in front of you can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believing things are terrible, and they're never going to be <unk> -- believe that there's nothing that you can do with <unk> social isolation, and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read your letter.
She lost his son by the 19 of January of this year, and he wrote me just a couple of days, and she was with her permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I imagine you are at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go on the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted you to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell their friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving to San Francisco to see the 49 line of 49 with his father in the 19 of January.
He never got there.
And I called the police of <unk> and I would take it out like disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my home and told me that the car of Mike was down on the bridge.
One witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before without having a real mental disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and go through the path that her son took that day, and also the courage to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I replied a radio call for a possible suicide guy on the sidewalk <unk> near the <unk>
<unk> my bike, and I noticed this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he crossed the <unk> and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the time and the next half, I heard this as Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided for her that day to come back to that lane and give life another chance.
When Kevin came back, I <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What did it do that <unk> and gave the hope and life another <unk>
And you know what told me.
He said, "I'm <unk>
They stopped me talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Lord <unk> Nothing to erase the <unk> events and you're one of the reasons why Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
He's been diagnosed with mental illness for which he has been properly <unk>
So Kevin when I only had six months completely unconscious from all those traits -- but thank God, we now know that.
Kevin is in order, as the said.
We give God for you.
I really had a debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And in the end, she wrote, <unk> When I visited San Francisco at San Francisco that night, you were <unk> as the patient.
<unk> I had to do it as well.
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and his depression with the hope that his story inspire others.
suicide is not just something that I've found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather <unk> with poison.
That act, despite the end of his own pain, gave me a chance to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider the suicide, they wouldn't think about hurt another person.
They just want their own pain.
Usually this is achieved only three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and calls from suicide around the bridge.
Out of those incidents I've been directly involved -- I've only lost two, but those two are too long.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
During that time, I would get my hand at three times.
On the end end, he looked at me, and he said, "I am sorry, but I have to go."
And then I <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of people that we get to contact in that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped from the bridge, and lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent -- most of those people have said that the second ones that leave the railing realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't just connect <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everybody and every one of us should be able to use to do.
The suicide can prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you're not, but in your inner you know what you are, and a question asks you, how do you get involved in that?
I have to be something only in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model that I had finally achieved the dream that I had ever been since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth with me.
For complicated reasons, I will go back later on, when I look at this picture -- I think, did you have <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just beginning.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, including our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin or the beliefs of those who surround us.
They are people who always challenge the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent even, ignored my story.
I think this enigma is called a revelation.
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> at birth because of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always wore this t-shirt on my head.
And my mom was, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair.
I knew how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex and mystery and <unk>
Because of my success, I never invited me to share my story, not because I thought to be what I'm bad, but why the world is about those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who embrace me as I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a god <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman first came up to me, and I remember that moment as a thing -- this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing man, I met this woman named <unk>
This is the head of a passionate beauty competition.
That night, she asked me, "Why haven't you ever been involved in the <unk>
He told me that if she <unk> she was responsible for the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won in suit I won in <unk> I won in <unk> and she was a third woman among over 40 candidate
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was from beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when they <unk> over the Philippines.
But most importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom.
I was hooked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know what if you give you the United States you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I would put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> at Thailand at 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand perform the most sophisticated <unk> sophisticated surgery.
At that time in the United States, it was necessary to have the surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's driver's license with the name of gender <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity document means power to drive or be able to get a <unk> but to me was the license to live, to feel <unk>
All of a sudden, my fears came out of <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be a model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who had lived her truth, but that, <unk> actually put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of the 20th of November we make a global waking for <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long story of people who are <unk> and stood up to injustice.
These are spinning. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best for others to live their truth without shame, no fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day there is no longer than 20 <unk>
My real profound truth led me to accept what I am.
Do you do?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you -- thank you --  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Yeah. <unk> <unk> first, thank you for all my <unk>
In my support network, my parents especially, to my family, which is very strong.
And I remember all the times that I've been to young women who were <unk> and sometimes when they called me and told me that their parents couldn't take it, I took the phone, and he said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked. It's not just the gender identity -- that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, everybody assigned a gender to birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table that sometimes that kind of task is not block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> And this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope you all be my allies.
KS: Thanks. <unk> Thank you.
In many tribal societies, and tribal societies, the parents usually know about their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007. And when his efforts were <unk> the efforts in 2011, to the <unk> National Prize, was made very <unk> a very popular girl in her country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the story of humanity, the history of women is the story of the <unk> of violence and violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the very beginning, when when they were born a child, your birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome not for her father, not by his mother.
The neighborhood comes back to the mother, the mother and nobody <unk> a father.
And a mother went to a lot for having a child.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first child, the first daughter, <unk>
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and the hope of a child, when she <unk> her third daughter, she feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just the mother of mine, but the daughter was just <unk> when it grows, it suffers too.
At age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays home and the school admits of her siblings.
Even as the age of 12 years, in a way, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
She can play with his friends on the street, and it can move around the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it is 13 years old, you prohibit home without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of your house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the name called honor of her father and her brothers and his family and his family, and if he took the code of that honor, he could even kill.
And it's interesting that this <unk> of honor, not only affects the life of a <unk> also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and his sisters of his sisters in the name of honor.
And there's a rule of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl must be very <unk> and very <unk>
That's the best judgment.
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and accepts the decisions of her father and her mother and the decisions of the age, even if they don't want.
If you <unk> it with a man who doesn't like or if the <unk> with an old man has to be <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk> of <unk>
If the <unk> very young, he has to take it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then it gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to her children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters and sisters, when she was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And long before I <unk> I thought about his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and I called my daughter so on.
But when I was <unk> all of them were men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line from my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half years.
You might wonder, why should I mention a girl in a school in a school?
Yeah, I must <unk>
You can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, in tribal societies, it's a great event for the old life.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
One led to school means that he has entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where they can explore their potential for future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when I went through the <unk> <unk> and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason that my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters not to his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
<unk> to sit with me when my friends came to see me.
<unk> to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to hang on on their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all of these good values in my school to girls and children alike.
I used education for <unk>
I went to my daughters, I taught students to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught the students to forget the lesson called <unk>
They <unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and they vote to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of engaging women in all social and economic activities and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
They were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the girls <unk> and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but very few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and tell them when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At 10 years, <unk> got up and raised by the right to education.
He wrote a daily blog diary for the BBC, he was offered herself for New York Times documentaries and he spoke on every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and the October nine of 2012, was shot in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I read her into my ear, "I must be <unk> by what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said, "Please, don't you <unk>
It was the right cause.
You know, your life in play for the cause of truth -- because of the cause of peace, and for the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and you get sick.
Both were on the right road, and God <unk>
These little words were very much to me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When <unk> was in the hospital and he had severe pains and strong headaches because his facial nerve, was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> on the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to be <unk> "I'm good with my smile, <unk> and <unk> in my face.
I'm going to put it right. Please don't stop.
It was a solace for us, and we <unk>
<unk> and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist in the hardest moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any age of 16 years.
<unk> when he doesn't have his task.
They fight your siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is especially in my mentoring that has made so bold to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm an engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the <unk> group of Google, where I've had an <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google -- but all the work that I talk about today here about the science of the brain, I did before you join Google or outside of my work there.
So having said that, there's a stigma when you get to a brain operation, you know.
You're still just as smart or not?
If you're not like that, you will be intelligent <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray matter, but it was the dead part of the heart that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide what quantity of taking out of a dozen different chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations of the combinations of the combinations of chemicals, and try to engage them to live alive.
More than one time I have saved myself.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I was going to try to get the dose of it, because there really doesn't have a map of what it says in <unk>
I began to test different different <unk> and I was shocked by looking at how small changes in the dose will dramatically dramatically -- my sense of who I am, my sense of who I am, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case -- for a few months, I tried and chemical doses for a man of 1900s, and I was surprised by looking at how I would <unk> my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  of course, many times in the past I've met various guys like this, or maybe some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my big surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit <unk> fixing a problem that was in the front, and it just wouldn't happen like this.
So I couldn't deal with it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that that experience gave me a new appreciation for men and what they have to do -- since I get better with men.
What I was trying to do is to adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so on, it was to regain my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thought -- my <unk> <unk>
<unk> thinking almost always in images, and that became my key point of reference, how I can do those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> to make new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like this.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of arguments about how the mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental for <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I can find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> that actually <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what if a film director was able to use his imagination only to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty doing this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments that were done by two leading groups in neuroscience.
Both of them used MRI technology, an image of functional magnetic resonance to represent the brain. You can see the brain scan made by <unk> <unk> and their colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of the brain of a person looking at an image.
The column in the middle shows the scan of that same individual while watching that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left -- you see the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine looking at that same picture.
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is the lab of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, it showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos as they were <unk> their brains to create a big pool of brain reactions to video sequences in front of the video.
And then I showed you a movie with new images, new people, new animals, and while they were getting a new <unk>
The computer -- using only brain information on the scanning -- to show you what seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This blew us down.
We're pretty close to doing that.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image and when you can imagine that same image, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This was done with the brain scan systems of larger resolution today, and their resolution was built to a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you get it?
There are many techniques to do that.
One is open up the skull and putting electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
Many of them are proposing new techniques of projection for imagery, including me -- with the recent MRI result -- first we need to ask the next, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, the most <unk> magnets only offer small improvements in the resolution, not increases by thousands of us as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of bigger magnets we make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different kinds of different <unk> like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a huge amount of effort in MRI were to make the big magnets big, right?
However, most recent advances in <unk> of ingenious and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> radio MRI systems.
In turn, instead of a magnetic field -- which is <unk> patterns of magnetic patterns <unk> to frequencies of radio radius.
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of <unk> radio processing, we can actually increase the data that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split our growing knowledge of the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid -- but the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and maybe even neural neural activity that I mentioned and maybe even neural activity.
Will we be able to put our ideas in direct shape to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go through the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how are we going to learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is something big.
These are big questions.
It would be compelling as a tool to amplify our thinking skills and communication.
Certainly, this very tool that could lead to Alzheimer's disease and similar disease.
We have few choices to open this door.
Anyway, you choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take much more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay candy.
I think we all have <unk>
Her closet may be telling some person for the first time you love or tell someone you're pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have done in life.
Every closet is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that closet that's a universal thing.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I was working in the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was standing there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> <unk> my armpits, quote from <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk>
And I'm going to be under the <unk> of my own short <unk> and I had my head <unk> and I was doing a little bit of my head -- I would usually ask me a little boy to say, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And it would appear a awkward silence at the table.
I had my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with one of the <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold look at his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and it was in the inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where I was a kid between three and 10 years old, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that next time I would say something.
That difficult conversation.
So after a few weeks, happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was prepared and I was about to go into the female issues at the table.  I had the camera on Betty <unk>
<unk>
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
And then I took a deep breath, and I went down and my back a four year-old girl with a little pink, looking at me, what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a little girl with a question: "Are you guys or <unk>
And then I took it deep back, and I got myself from <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is somewhat confusing.
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw a kid, but I am a girl, and you know, as you like to wear a pink, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Because I am more than a girl of a <unk> <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> paying attention, and he said, "My favorite soldier is <unk> and he has a fish.
You can give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was it. Just "Oh, fine. You're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the hardest conversation that I ever had.
And because of <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both we were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But in the dark, you can't know what color the walls.
You just know how it feels like living in a closet.
It's like my closet is not different from you or yours or yours.
<unk> I'm going to give you 100 reasons why you get out of my closet was harder than coming out of his, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who has declared online online to say it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story I tell you is harder to tell your five-year-old <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, there's only the difficult thing.
We need to stop classifying what is difficult to do with respect to the other person to make us feel better or worse than our <unk> and we need to just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls, <unk> a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine 20 years ago.
And I had a horse, and a horse dress and <unk> shoes.
It was not the militant lesbian prepared to fight any child in four years who would go into the coffee.
I was frozen in fear of fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet my truck, gay grenade and the moving one muscle is the hardest thing I've ever done.
My family, my whole friends with whom I spent my whole life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was turned around to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't launch that <unk> you kill you.
One of my more memorable grenade was on my sister.
It was the first time that many of the guests all guests -- they knew that I was gay, and by doing my <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to a where the friends of my parents, people who knew me was years old.
And after talking a moment, one of the women I said, <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> meet my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
What is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite favorite program, Will and Grace did.
And you know who <unk> us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but instead of showing desperately your support, to make me know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband is using shirt shirts <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as they have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with someone, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing you want.
That's how hard conversations continue without my strong point.
Ask for anyone who I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of the Girl <unk>
Now, please look at this through the <unk> perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in coffee had no <unk> but I was ready for the struggle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the others need to know we also suffer.
Number two: Be direct just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know that they're gay, <unk>
If they say to their parents that maybe they might be gay, they keep the hope that that could change.
They don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  let the complex.
You communicate its truth.
They would never be embarrassed by that.
And some of them can be wounded hurt by what they've done, but they're never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some people will feel <unk> but that's something in them.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark closet a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you might feel so themselves, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has seen intelligence, a productive example has been the famous quote quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine may think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critical to the <unk> of computing like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, I took a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
Let's take a walk.
First of all, let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that you're from an alien race that you don't know anything about the biology of the Earth or from the Earth not from the Earth or the intelligence on Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason why we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from an alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that doesn't have any concept about intelligence on Earth, you would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, until a certain moment in time, the asteroids that we <unk> on the surface of an aquatic planet stop doing it.
And that's why I claim that this is the same question that understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led several years ago, I studied a variety of themes through science, through several different disciplines, I believe, towards a only underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately and adjusted to the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that restore the diversity of possible future <unk>
Finally, in the planning of robotic movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so taking all of these different subjects and <unk> together, and I asked them together, and there's a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
Is there just an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is an F, F, that acts in order to maximize future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keep the open choices with a magnetic force, with the diversity of possible future accessible, Yes, to an imminent time -- future <unk>
In a nutshell, of intelligence, you don't like to get <unk>
intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep our open choices.
And so, having to realize this equation, it's natural to ask: what can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human <unk>
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that the universes that make more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have tendency to conditions more hospitable to the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually it comes directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy in any of the system that you can find in.
<unk> <unk> could go through multiple animal evidence -- play human games, and even making money to be able to make any money to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> human <unk> here we see <unk> automatically <unk> a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided for her to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance has applications for robotic robotics applications and human assistance technology.
This ability of tools will have applications in productive manufacturing.
Moreover, just like some other animals can cooperate just pulling opposite sides of a string at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This ability to cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections into a social network where our friends are constantly constantly constantly constantly constantly constantly keeping the whole net network.
This same capacity of network network also has applications in health care, in energy and intelligence.
So here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a boats, and discovering successfully and using the Panama Canal to expand globally.
In the same way, <unk> is largely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
And finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a set of simulated negotiation negotiation in their exponentially.
This risk management skill will have huge applications in finance and secure.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of human behaviors, such as use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all flow of one equation, that leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the term <unk> the <unk> <unk> there was always the concept that if you were looking at smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion, there would be.
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had the whole concept of rebellion, in reverse.
It's not the machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the other thing that the impulse to take control of all future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that mass intelligence can actually emerge from taking control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
They often ask me, how do you look for targets we learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to happen to the descendants of the descendants to help you build artificial <unk> or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence has to be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
In the last few years, we've extended our knowledge of how the Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The Kepler Kepler has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which points to the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures quantum intensity of stars when planets go over in front of them, and blocking a little bit of that light that will come to us.
The data gathered by Kepler to show the sizes of planets besides the distance that there are between them and their mother.
In together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets from our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their own.
It gives it clues about whether these planets we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we're finding this treasure.
The year 2014, was the <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us since the millennia, are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have <unk> our ability to alter its course.
But I'm not a scientist of climate, and I don't know.
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover lives beyond our planet.
I could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as a very interested person in the pursuit of life in the universe, I can tell you that the more I look for planets similar to the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a world potentially livable world -- this is a mission like the <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we study both to Mars.
Our <unk> like the <unk> are tracking their surface to search for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples from the atmosphere and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
private companies are now providing not just short space flights but also the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images, they remind us of the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still remain <unk> places that are really <unk> in comparison to Mars.
Even in the most dry places and highest on the Earth is cool and filled with oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests thousands of miles away.
I'm worried that this excitement about Mars colonization, and other planets tend to get a big and sad chunk of the implication, and the belief in some that Mars will expect there to save us from this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that is truly livable Earth.
For a lot that I like the exploration, I'm deep disagree with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but say that Mars will be there to save humanity is how you imagine the captain of the Titanic to tell us that the party of truth will have place later on the <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for civic exploration, and the drug preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of trying to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
It's just getting closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile and <unk> areas of the land, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
Let me leave you with an experiment experiment, the paradox of <unk>
Many years ago, the physicist, Enrico Fermi Enrico Fermi I asked, did I realize that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found out of the existence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced enough to consider to continue between the stars, they lose the notion of how important the origin of the planets that are protecting this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization <unk> we save ourselves from ourselves, but the <unk> exploration, and exploration exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to measure the hostile environments on Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the even easier task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I put my own home.
And as I was on the front porch looking in my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were on the dining table, where there were <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all good.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get to, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe to the next morning, and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive, but sure that no more expensive than a <unk> at half night, so I thought that despite the circumstances, I really stopped.
I'm a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that the heart rate increases the heart of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to the counter counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I began to ask myself, if there was something I could do, systems that I could put in place, which would be a bad thing to happen.
Or at least, if you happen, bad things, you know, the probability of being a total catastrophe of it.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts were not <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny <unk> winner of the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed told him that I broke the window, and that I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that he had been practicing something called hindsight <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what's the <unk>
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong, yeah?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that you could get wrong, then tries to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not that evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious thing.
In the house, it will be a place for things that are <unk>
This sounds of common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over the course of thousands of years, to get track of the location of the important things, where the fish, where the fish, the trees are going to tell the trees -- where tribes are friends and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that allows you to <unk> find your nuts.
And if you ask if somebody really did the experiment, they cut the sense of the <unk> and they could still find her nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move too good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing your car your car <unk>
So at home, I would have a place for the keys, a hook on the door, maybe a plate of <unk>
For your passport, a particular drawer for it.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you can take a place and they are <unk> with it your stuff will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take the cell phone, a photo of your credit card license, passport. <unk> by mail to yourself for yourself in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases it.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thought.
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we're not at the best time, and you have to put the systems on its site.
And there's perhaps not more stressful situation than when you get to a medical decision.
And at some point, we all will be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or one to be dear, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> like a <unk> for all other medical decisions, and actually for decision-making decisions and social decisions -- any kind of decision that we need to take a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose they go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with greater risk of heart disease, heart attack.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you might have heard of the <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> medications in the world today, even you are likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you should do then, a statistic that you should be asking for most doctors don't want to talk about, and the drug companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number needs to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or submit to a surgery in any medical procedure before you can help one person.
And you must think of what kind of statistic is it <unk>
The number has to be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not a doctor, and if it's somebody's somebody's about scientists like me.
We haven't understood the mechanisms for <unk>
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number needs to deal with the most widely <unk> which think it is?
How many people have to take it before you can take one person?
300.
This is according to the research of <unk> <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk>
I explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the medicine for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, or another event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 of my <unk>
Why does it not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for everybody <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic and it is, <unk> of <unk> <unk>
For this particular cell, the side effects occur in five percent of the patients.
And those include <unk> <unk> with muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, "The five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still taking the <unk>
But a moment.
remember they don't think clearly.
So think of how to do this over time, so you don't have to build the thinking chain on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has taken it five percent of the 300 people have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get away from the drug that you can help your drug help you.
I don't say they should not take the <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic is part of the first informed consent first.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I have launched this number in the air of the crash, but actually this number one needs to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that is going to be done in the largest men in the <unk> of the prostate of prostate cancer, the number we need to deal with is <unk>
So 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just to take you a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can argue that we would embrace the conversation forward.
You don't have to do this on the act.
And they also want to think about quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, they want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that might have much pain towards the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at the time is that a lot of systems.
There's a evolutionary reason for this.
Face on the face with a predator -- you don't need the <unk> system, or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending metabolism in those things, not react to being lunch -- so nothing matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational logical thought -- as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown me.
So we need to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail in time.
The idea is to think of the future how those things could be <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help to minimize harm, or to prevent the bad things into the first place.
<unk> at the night of <unk> in <unk> when I returned from my journey, my contractor installed a <unk> of combination with the door, with a key way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't ordered and lots of messages I haven't read.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a process of <unk> and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical sign.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even <unk>
Four hundred <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree -- you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> you can never get a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs, the <unk> besides a little bit of my own story.
The French sign language came over the 1800s, and over the time time, it mixed with local signals, and the language was developed as a <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that the sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a world of sound, it is as if I lived in a foreign country, following their rules, <unk> behaviors and rules without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound of it.
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I have learned, for example.
"Don't <unk> the <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise by eating the <unk> <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, you're not going to be covered in the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound label more than the average person does it.
I'm a super <unk> of sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk>
I would keep going.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, doing my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I have four lines on the paper.
In the year 2008, I had a chance to travel Berlin, Germany, for an artistic house there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and while I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has entered my territory of art.
I'm going to get more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be that way.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't only experience through your ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound and <unk> sound in my artistic practice.
And all I had taught me in terms of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the artistic community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention I graduated.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was a kind of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic work, or I could be <unk>
I chose to get me wrong.
There's a massive culture around the language of speech.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me and support my voice.
That way, I'm able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the work and institutions, work with lots of different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> his voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value as well as you take a very high interest rate.
If I will not continue to do this practice, I feel that I could do it in the forget and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound as my new artistic medium <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by looking at the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot be capture and expressing on the paper.
And the same thing can be said of a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much of the signals as well as the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So imagine a piano.
<unk> divide in many different parameters, different <unk>
If you can <unk> a different <unk> for each finger as you touch the piano, like facial expression, the movement movement -- the speed, the shape of your hand, and so while you touch the piano, English is a linear language, as if you were <unk> just one button at once.
However, <unk> is more like a chord -- you need the 10 fingers in the order to express a clear concept, or an idea in <unk>
If just a key would change the chord it would create a completely different meaning of it.
The same thing happens with music in terms of pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different <unk> parameters can be able to express different ideas.
For example, the signal is <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> on that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
DR: oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I got to think, and if I look at the <unk> through the lens of music?
If I had to create a sign and put it over and again, it could become like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and you put it.
This is <unk>
If I <unk> it and <unk> the visually speed, you see as a piece of music.
All day long.
I feel that the same thing can be said by <unk> the <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance your body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time -- we would have again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of four times per <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> same time."
Look at <unk> right hand <unk> left left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a way of the hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
Everybody with your hands on top.
Now we're going to do it both in the head like the chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> same time."
Yes, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second one that I'd like to show you is this. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please take it again.
And over again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good work.
So look at how three signs are very similar -- everyone in your head and the chest but they can make very different meanings of it.
It's amazing to see how <unk> is alive and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound automatically doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines the social value and allow them to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> you don't have to hear the music.
<unk> is a rich trove of trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, you can get in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can tell you everything, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom means responsibility.
But my imagination led to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in an innocence of innocence or a ignorance bubble. I should say, because adults would lie to us from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I found out that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good at cleaning each other.
The time, now I'm an adult and teaching citizenship and invention in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk on the beach on beach beach with lots of trash.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, and we collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But lasts for eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very expensive and also to use those enormous devices.
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started to build this <unk> work <unk> so that the very <unk> children can also participate.
And I will tell you the kids who manipulate electrical tools are really cool, and they feel great.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce it to the size we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of their <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave you with my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas from every child and try to convince them something that we hope it works.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we took an image of this <unk> the kids get very upset.
Then we create very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turned a light bulb and camera cameras on accessories. And we put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see those pieces of plastic floating through the sensor while the computer on board processing this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get a measure of the amount of plastic in the water.
I would take this step back on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that somebody else would take it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and they are trying to fix it immediately.
Now, my graduate problem, my <unk> but my students in Hong Kong are very well kids.
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and it was <unk> with this picture.
A child, maybe 10 years -- cleaning a oil spill, just wearing the hands of the hands of <unk> the world's largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were really shocked because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water is <unk> the water where they live.
You can also see that water is brown and the mud and the oil is also brown color, and when everything is <unk> it's very difficult to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> that can be addressed through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> which can help to identify what there is in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or through a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I saw a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe I could address a more difficult problem, and even closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> <unk> various cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant from Fukushima, a nuclear central nuclear power plant.
And today, according to the reports of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Pacific has traces of pollution in the ground.
If we go to the west coast, we can measure ultraviolet radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast -- and most of the time, it has a safe, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the crash and survey independently with other scientists, the land -- and we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night I went to the center of <unk> here is the use of <unk>
It might seem like they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with the <unk> their entire life.
Along with them with them, we discussed the data -- that day and we talk about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the region of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigment in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the radioactive dust <unk> from the peak of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this we organize an expedition and the closest to the nuclear power to date.
We zoom in to a half miles of the nuclear station, and with the fishermen help of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem with a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales -- also with open source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so small so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turn it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's at the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with metal wood, and chemistry -- a little bit of biology, of fibers, basically, you can build almost everything.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become reality with adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked us things like, "How can we invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy?
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the age of age, transforming their lawn chairs into new vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So scientific citizens, <unk> creators, we need to prepare the next generation to worry about the environment and the people, and to really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two different cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a single silk shell.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other thing I thought it would be.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the marble in raw, he saw a figure that struggle to be free.
The <unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living things are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information to do it for every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> manufacturing and mass production.
The lines of <unk> have dictated a world -- it <unk> the imagination of designers and architects to think of their objects as <unk> of different parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with pores <unk>
The skins of the back are <unk> <unk> with little <unk>
One acts primarily as filter the other thing as a barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there is no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that makes gradually its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here's a divided screen that represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and an architect to work in the right now between the <unk> and the gene between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the organism, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the law, and it shows up on the two screens after me.
My work, in your simplest level, is to bring these two visions of the world, stepping off the assembly and close to growth.
You can probably ask yourself, Why is it?
Why wasn't it possible for 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a weird moment in history, where they connect four disciplines that offer designers access to tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through scales, large scale, like this robotic arm with an scope of 24 meters in diameter with a base base that someday not very far to print buildings <unk> buildings, and graphics made of genetically genetically altered <unk> they glow in the dark.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every groove is the unique size to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a fashion club of Paris with <unk> they're going <unk> It's like a second skin made of one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with red printing collaborator <unk> we print this layer and super 3D <unk> with the cells, I'll show more objects like that.
This <unk> <unk> and rigid <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of an MRI scanner there.
That designers have access to this high-resolution high-resolution high-resolution instruments that allows you to design products that are <unk> not just the way our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair a chair at both structural structural and also absorb sound.
Professor <unk> my collaborator, <unk> the nature of <unk> and by designing this <unk> pattern -- becomes <unk>
So we put this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
His surface, as in nature, varies its functionality not through addition to another material or another <unk> but continuously <unk> and <unk>
But it's nature <unk>
There is no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious Jew but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them was stuck and came to define a lot of what it matters.
Like she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a rubber tree, <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between trunk, and they were <unk> and <unk>
The whole tree was an <unk>
Instead, the land made the trees up with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The Earth created a world that was made.
I often ask myself, "What would be the design if the objects were made of one part?
It was a better state of <unk>
So we look for the material to put the kind of material in the tree with fruit and fruit with fruit and we found it.
The second largest <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons is produced every year by organisms like shrimp, crabs, <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we can tune their property, we could generate <unk> structures on one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call this a legal <unk>  We asked a bunch of seed <unk> the <unk> and we produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures a system was built on a multiple <unk> of <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made of one material 3.5 feet long, 100 percent recycled.
When the pieces are ready, they let them dry up to find a natural form of contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process used to contain <unk> <unk> that showed up for the first time on planet 3.5 billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria genetically engineered to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems from lighting up to mesh and mesh and even more <unk>
A tree <unk> <unk> tree.
Working with an old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of shrimp from shrimp in an architecture that acts like a tree.
And here is the best part, for <unk> <unk> to <unk> the sea, <unk> life and placed in the ground, they'll help grow a tree.
The match for our next exploration of the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to maintain life for <unk>
To do that, we must master bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> board, we did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like liquid <unk> only instead of <unk> metals -- we are <unk> new biological biological inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We put our own 3D channels to control the flow of these crops.
In our first piece of clothing -- two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the <unk> water.
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
It turns out light into sugar, the other consumed sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms, don't interact in nature.
In fact, it never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think about it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like the tract tract -- that will help you get into these bacteria and to make it <unk> their function of the way.
So we began to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material on <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> they get more transparent.
This system flies <unk> when you stretch from one end to another, it's 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football camp and 10 times more than our little intestine on our gut.
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels bright channels with life inside the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are finished <unk> -- only half is <unk>
What if the design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin -- and we can turn out the adult tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way to edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
For now, you know that a 3D printer involves material in layers.
It also knows that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home within which he <unk>
The manufacturing is not about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of not two materials, but of two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue, or the matrix, by exposing those fibers to each other.
And this is happening across scales.
The silk worm first turn into the environment, creates a structure of tension, and then starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a worm <unk> to <unk>
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of silk worm.
However, when you put the silk worm on a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that <unk> a caterpillar and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different environments -- different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape -- the structure of <unk> <unk> directly through the environment.
And they often get down the silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we can shape the raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
They were <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk <unk> and we put ourselves on our site.
We knew that silk worms, <unk> to more dark and <unk> and so we use a solar route diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the light of light and the heat, which silk worms.
We were ready to get to <unk>
We asked <unk> <unk> silk worms.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were <unk> with us.
We put them very carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
Al <unk> biological silk on spider silk -- they give all this pavilion out of it.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other <unk> empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which leads to a design inspired by nature to an inspired nature of the design of the design that demands us, for the first time, that we take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked them, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they were when they asked them for the first time.
You can <unk> your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if you ask the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who never could answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English English, the <unk> and art and developing websites -- I played the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
You may have heard of us.
And generally I like to test and persist anyway, because I have dedicated long time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But over time, this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, comes to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I got involved with something else, something completely different, and I get involved in it, and I let me absorb and I feel <unk> I have found <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to let it go.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all of my other passions, and let them go to <unk>
Another reason why I had so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad about me at all.
I was concerned to be afraid of engagement, or being dispersed, or <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate my story, and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have asked me then.
You know, you know, where they learned to assign the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where you did, they learned about culture.
So you ask ourselves, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years old.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they were at that age.
It's considered a naive question to create nice answers in kids like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question we can do over and over again as we grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students ask them to be asked to be on university.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of before the way the sleep takes us.
Why?
Now, while this question inspires kids to dream with what they might not be, I don't inspire dreaming of everything they might be.
In fact, right the opposite, because when somebody asks you what you want to be, you can't respond with 20 different things, although adults well-intentioned maybe <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>   and he's <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned into <unk> and <unk> and creative principal.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But that's more than that.
<unk> notion is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real one, the idea that every one of us has something that will be going to spend during your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is, and to devote your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that bring their curiosity and lots of different things to do?
There is no place for someone in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And feeling something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
It's a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> so to say.
I could help if you divide in three parts: and <unk> and <unk>
You can also use other terms, you can use the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the Renaissance time, the ideal was who was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara Barbara refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems to me as a species to adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or woe you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there's huge strengths on being this way.
Here's three superpowers ...
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> his shared interests in cartography, visualization.
<unk> is a company who creates jewelry <unk>
From <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea by his <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
So there are new ideas.
And <unk> with all their background, can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower, <unk> is learning fast.
When we sell them into something, we're going to do that.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less fear of testing new things and get out of comfort.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything we learned to every new area that we have, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a full-time <unk> and <unk>
As a child who was an amazing ability to develop the muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before it became a writer, <unk> was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the finest sales mechanics when they were starting their practices and this ability to write for the arguments for the editors.
<unk> is a loss of time going to be going to be able to get to what you can even tell you -- even if at the end I read it.
You can apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is adaptability. I mean, the ability to transform into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of <unk> others, sometimes consultant at Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and, sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because it's a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> Magazine defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> which are the individuals and organizations that can be used to meet the needs of the market, the ones that are really <unk>
Let's think about ideas and quickly learning about three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they're <unk> to reduce their targets.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging them to be themselves.
We have complex problems, and we have <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to cope with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> <unk> knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams made up of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put into ideas and <unk> it provides a breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> most of them are <unk> to be more like their fellow <unk>
One time said this, if there's one thing you can take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the inner wiring -- whatever it is.
If you are a heart of heart, then <unk> all the media.
That's where you get the best of you.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who have just noticed one of them in the last 12 minutes, --  I say, <unk> with your lots of passions.
Keep your curiosity for those <unk> of <unk>
They take the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring takes us to a more authentic life and happy.
And perhaps most important, <unk> the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In the year we went to a woman named <unk> they took the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for she until unfortunately passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a look and found <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before.
Even more shocking,
If I had been alive today, we could not give her more help for her than he <unk> he gave him <unk>
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient in receiving a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has moved a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> a lot of treatments for cancer, antiretroviral them for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has been moved into Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million worldwide.
But 2050, 2050, will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you wait to live to 85 years, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one of every two.
In other words, there is the probability of the odds that you spend your <unk> or Alzheimer's or helping care of a friend or to be dear Alzheimer's disease.
In America, Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spent in Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and their costs to increase a <unk> increase in 2050, as we get the generation of <unk>
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide, Alzheimer's is the only one you cannot cure or cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we have invested less time and money in the research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times a year in cancer research that in Alzheimer's despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people knows, but everybody <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can get it out.
For most of the last <unk> years, all of us even, scientists, Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain in comparison with a Alzheimer's disease to see the actual physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger severe memory of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's significantly life expectancy is always fatal.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule, like a piece of paper that folds up as a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up well, these points will end up inside the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots come out of the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of Alzheimer's patients.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, like defuse a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that you would do, and then create a drug that is doing it.
Until recently, in his most part, they have gotten down the cords and waited for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> <unk> physicists, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now there's a new kind of drugs which are testing specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our latest results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at a few videos of what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick with each other inside them, as in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms early into stage, then we see that they <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome, but the research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there are real hope for what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to get that hope, about overcoming Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to convince you that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we get it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have downloaded more research and pressure on governments, drug industry, drug industry, and <unk>
That was essential to move on HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
We see that same unit today to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the hidden, caregivers of their loved ones day and night, are often too <unk> to get out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the peril.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> that cannot create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking for them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
<unk> this article in the New York Times column in the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, you do this.
The article about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience when I test it as a night last night.
So the procedure is pretty simple: Two strangers will be done to get 36 questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or skill, what would be?
Number three: When was the last time you ask another person?
And then I <unk>
They <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like from him or it -- I know I'm very honest about this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've ever met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me the attention, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to <unk>
So I was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had a chance to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly very well, I didn't expect <unk>
However, we were <unk> and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I send her to the original Love column, a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you will probably wonder, do you still have?
And the reason I think you challenge this is because I've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
A week before the article was very nervous.
I'd been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had invited me to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog input can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends, and I imagined my article in the New York Times would be probably a few thousand views.
And that came a good burden of attention to a relatively new relationship.
But as he was given, I had no idea.
The article was released on a Friday at night, and at Saturday, this happened on my blog.
And the Sunday, I've already called the USA Show and the Good <unk> <unk>
In one month, the article got over eight million views, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing with it, about own <unk> experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of an has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it or the <unk> what they did every day for weeks of weeks, they were all doing the same question: still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase: <unk> <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and <unk> like this.
I was interviewed in radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the scale of the answer.
<unk> questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article for San <unk> that included the experiences of readers when I test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first momentum was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that both of us did a public onset together.
<unk> television interviews, and we <unk> the requests for some of us two.
I think I was afraid of being in the icons of <unk> of the process of <unk> -- a range of which I didn't feel at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, and they wanted to know if they really <unk> I mean, if it was able to produce <unk> love not only adventure, but love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship was just a few months and I felt, especially that people asked the wrong question.
How do you know whether to play it together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for <unk> <unk> among university students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants felt more close after doing that, several later studies, also used as a quick way to create confidence and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community, and they have used them between people in the opposite policy.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and he said to me and he said to me and he said to me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to say that you love you from the person with whom I <unk>
Well he made a pause.
I think she only wants to be friends.
I said, but became better friends?
I know that they were able to get better at getting better after the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation here.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what my whole adult life, and he was my first true love, and he had no idea how or I could live without him.
So I turned into science.
And I was looking at everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I hoped that that could sort of love the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just did for the book that I was writing for, but in retrospect, it really seems to be <unk>
I thought if I joined the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad, and I used to be then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I am more <unk> I am more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I came up.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably can demand me.
What I'm looking for of the love is an assumption not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to remain <unk> indefinitely for the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee about what people wanted to know if they were still together.
The story that the media told you about 36 questions about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way for some ways to mitigate some of the <unk> risk, and this is a very scary story, because in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we are really willing to accept the short version of history.
The story version of the story that I ask, still together?
And their content with a yes or No.
So more than a question -- let me ask you to make more difficult questions, questions like, How do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things become <unk> and how do you know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with the uncertainty that inevitably has a relationship? Or even more, how do you live in your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known one, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, but we still keep together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love, it's not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article. Love did not happen.
<unk> in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit to read it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything that a choice.
I didn't think how many times we have both to take that decision, and how much times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing whether he would have I always choice or not.
I want it to be enough to have done it and responded 36 questions, to have chosen to love someone so generous, and fun and have expressed that election in the largest U.S. newspaper.
But what I've done in change, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really think of.
And what I'm going to do, and what I might spend my life is that that myth is true.
I want to be happy implicit in the title of my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose someone, and the hope that he also love, me, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a few lesbian in full mountain, and I sort of got a <unk> of the forest.
The city of New York was a time.  One thing that really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and I would give you a dollar, of one dollar, a pen and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or a few of you would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it's been <unk> because here I am, 30 years later and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment, I was in <unk> <unk> like going through <unk> and I <unk> and all of those things, I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and made a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style Agnes Martin, I covered them from resin and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid to bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite of it in a way that it seemed to rise up size, as if it was that we had the text with a <unk>
So I did I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding some electronic elements of windows and <unk> bottles that I was finding out the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to convince me and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that my God can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> drawing just like a dead body does a crime scene.
And I took out the objects and I created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, you can make an idea.
Then I made insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
Was that great man.
At some point I became interested in human form, sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
And it was great, except for one thing: I get stuck.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to drawing on a window on a window on another window and another window, and I had all these windows that came together with a three-dimensional composition of view.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work -- with something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> garden of <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know it.
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 kilos.
5.5 meters long.
It has double face, which is 10 feet of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of the blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with skin heads travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, to this <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
This is where creatures with animal heads are headed by the <unk> ready for suicide in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the refuge of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of strange things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand goes out and clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in <unk>
So it's a aspect of <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand that we <unk>
And then when you go to the other hand, you have a <unk> like a bird <unk> and it spits out of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> feet long of a snake tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn on fire to a <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why I did that.
Things that go up, you know.
Their tail ends up in a eyeball of <unk> made from terrorists in 1986.
They have <unk> them.
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of the terrorists.
It's very <unk> at the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of file in a form of human being, and they travel in <unk> groups, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, they come together.
And you can walk in between them. It's bringing me years.
Each one is basically a <unk> microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds of a human being trapped inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> he's the chest, you can <unk> the ticket.
I'm going to accompany them by the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall coming out of the chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick refresher of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see them.
This is a <unk> body in half.
This has two heads and he's communicating between the two.
There are some pills coming out and come into the head of this strange statue here.
There's a little forest of forest inside the Google <unk>
Can you <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> like the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box called <unk> <unk>
Inside this box is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician -- a musician -- a radio, a radio, a school, a school arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world, and a garden.
<unk> the box and all of the people in hits each other like particles.
And I think that's how to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box is living on.
And together we came to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, of religion, doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill that you have against pain, first goes on the stomach, the bowels and other organs.
They're going to take a pill that is the most effective and <unk> system so that any drug can actually make it in your body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs that are doing to decrease the number of viruses in blood -- and increase the heart of blood cells.
But they are also known by their side side effects on its own negative, because in the time you take it to your current stream, it gets <unk> and worse for the time you take it to its destiny, which is where most importantly, in HIV <unk>
These are regions of the body as the lymph nodes -- the nervous system, our lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood stream of patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new stem cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of life run by the oral <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> do the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for pressure and surgery of diabetes, you can be used for any <unk> thing, including transportation <unk>
In fact, we're using pulses of laser pulses to open or drill extremely small holes, which open up and close and close the cells infected with HIV to put their medications.
You wonder, "What is that <unk>
We sent a small <unk> laser beam on the cellular membrane with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even realize, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> plates, but the goal is to take this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"What is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we'll do a <unk> in the place of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is going to go to the place of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that drives it directly into the site of infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep the open cells.
Well, this doesn't seem a long time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV of the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every researcher of the <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups -- not <unk> organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
They do what these groups do when they're not shooting 'n.
My goal is to understand better to these individual agents of violence and study ways of encouraging violent involvement to non-violent confrontation, not violent.
I do the field work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding to these groups is key to solving almost all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
no.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors of non-governmental actors.
For instance, of the <unk> peace arrangements and 2011, <unk> were signed between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even need to be <unk> or <unk> in any world of successful conflicts.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but no one looks at what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and politics is not armed with it.
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without global vision.
<unk> groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known by its violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a web of social services and a military device.
Similarly, Palestinian <unk> known for his suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> in Gaza since 2007.
So these groups do more than just to fire.
They're multitasking
<unk> an complex communication machinery stations could radio, television channels and websites web web websites and strategies on social networks.
And here they have the printed magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups also invest in a complex fundraising.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they run hospitals, they put professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
Political groups also try to conquer the population by offering something that the state will not buy security and protection.
The <unk> of the Taliban in an Afghanistan ripped through the war, or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can also be scanned the efforts of these groups for delivering safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a safe price for the population.
But in general, to provide social services means filling a empty, a <unk> gap by the government, and allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we looked at the <unk> groups just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are hybrid here.
<unk> because they fill out gaps by government, and they emerge as armed and political groups participate in the violent struggle and give governance.
And the more sophisticated and sophisticated ones are these organizations, we can fewer <unk> as opposed to a state.
How do I call a group like <unk>
They were part of a territory, and they run all its <unk> they collected the garbage, you run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without the state and hybrids and the weakest the more weak states, like in the Middle East -- more <unk> and they fill that gap the actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups are going to be investing more in the military tools.
<unk> that governance gap has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we better understand groups that are able to understand them, we better understand what incentives to offer to foster violence from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors were not <unk> military power can win some battles, but not giving peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that safety <unk> to fill that security emptiness that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My views of gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid that accepting openly the tag of <unk> it would be unfair for <unk>
I am <unk> but pretty bad.
And so I was feeling like a bad feminist.
Or, at least I wrote a piece, and a book called "The <unk> and then in interviews people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant myself and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and the 20 years old, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and they have to take sex. As if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated women around the world and the anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that might be feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist age, a taboo and unpleasant word.
I <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which asks too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's like or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman, and you can't imagine someone else.
At the time, as I was growing up, I started accepting that I am, indeed, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same job for the same job.
We have a right to travel around the world as it <unk> from <unk> or violence.
We have a right to use easy and accessible to the contraceptives and the services of it.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for checks or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about women's needs, you have to have our other <unk>
We're not only women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition and skills and much more.
We need to have these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is not anything.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I hear music music <unk>
Although the letter degrades the women and a offends me, the classic <unk> of the yin yang <unk> is amazing.
<unk> reality with your shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get rid of the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I am completely <unk> by my musical situations.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The rose is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion magazines and the nice stuff.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the <unk> fairy tales, which makes you happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of her husband, it's his choice, and I'm not a person who is to <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her children, I accepted that choice as well.
The problem is not that it gets economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women financially vulnerable when they <unk>
So let's put this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of color women, the gay workers, gay workers, gay workers, and <unk> for women white <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism I'm a very bad feminist a very bad feminist here.
It also happens to be this: As a neuroscientist, I feel so much pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that it was really <unk>
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I consider myself <unk> from that <unk> before you try to put me there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and innovative leaders are afraid of being tagged like <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> for fear of what that device means that <unk> is not going to be able to fulfill the very realistic expectations.
Take an example of <unk> or like I call it.
In the last few years, it's a <unk>
In the <unk> Music <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was an <unk> show -- seeing this <unk> star embrace the Feminism and to know women and young men who are a feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics started endless debates whether it was not a feminist.
It would give her feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult and <unk> woman.
<unk> perfection is because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot of <unk> we need so much.
We go much beyond sensible critical and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until it's nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad question of feminism, or rather, a feminism more <unk> is the point.
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to give it a little more <unk>
If I hear music music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be rather happy to providing an supply supply.
These artists are not going to change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> the change affecting actually their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why does his music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worst choice.
But when bad decisions justify that it makes it harder for women to achieve equality, equality we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my three and four years.
It's two girls and <unk> and brilliant, and also very brave. I want to grow in a world.
It's where they are <unk> by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option is <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is about sexual violence against women as sport, including the play of <unk>
We can change the radio waves when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies are not treated women as well as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting sports sports where athletes treat their peers as <unk>
In any case, men, especially male white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in their magazine, to participate in their project, or work with you, until they don't have enough of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people.
Those of us who are <unk> but we're going to be able to participate in these kinds of projects, but we can also engage them to be including as much as we are <unk> to overcome barriers to the decision jobs.
Because we are not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our achievements will mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and expect our decisions to come to the top, to people in the power directors and producers of film and music and music, <unk> the <unk> people who can make great decisions and more courageous, to create a meaningful and significant change.
We can also claim with bravery our feminism, or bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not to be in <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I tell you about everything, because my voice was <unk> and Feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to deal with what happened.
A few boys would tell me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated as if it was anything.
I started to believe that it wasn't anything.
<unk> my voice, and after all, I didn't think I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I get into a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and they understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that it wasn't anything.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write as myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and feminism, I also discovered that if I was a little brave -- another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is nothing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I argue the way that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad basis. I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way of thinking, what I do, and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same.
I hope that we can all be a little bit courageous, when you need about such a <unk>
Right after Christmas last year, <unk> kids in California had been <unk> because I visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things of this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be lousy for a child with an <unk> immune system is one of the most effective diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but a lot of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something allegedly <unk>
But a moment, it wasn't the article that unleashed the argument that autism and vaccines were disqualified and marked by being a fraud called by the British Medical fraud.
They don't believe most of smart scientists than the theory that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know it, but millions of parents around the world are still assuming that vaccines are in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rise of autism rise in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about her create his entire professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, estimates of prevalence was stable only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> as <unk> <unk> refer to routinely autism as an epidemic, as if I could <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you are not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Center for Disease Control <unk> what's going on, they tend to based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic <unk> and "A better detection detection to explain these degraded numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> much the fears of a young mother looking for in the face of her son of two years, visual contact.
If the diagnosis of diagnosis had to figure out why they were so reduced to the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to find the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is and how it discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark parts of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins <unk> In <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed <unk> <unk> worlds who looked around, even their own parents.
You could have fun for hours waving your hands in front of her face, but they were panic by <unk> as when he didn't put his favorite toy in his usual place without knowing them.
The foundation of the patients treated in his clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the decade of 1950, as primary authority of the world in the subject, I declared to see less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as far as they were talking about places from as distant as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for the diagnosis of autism were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was <unk> that he had turned to nine out of every 10 kids sent by other doctors to be <unk> without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child caused by cold parents.
These kids, he said, have been very carefully kept in a fridge not <unk>
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that they cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before it was two.
When her mother put one of his favorite records and he properly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad view of these skills, claiming things like the kids were just simply getting rid of what they had heard their parents, desperate to win their approval for the rest.
As a result, autism became source for the families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started to test the theory theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist. I thought the theory of <unk> mothers of <unk> was quite stupid.
She and her husband John was warm and <unk> and they had a very profound autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like black-eyed Susie! No special education, no special education, and without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Service of Health who had more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done about 30 years before.
They launched a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
<unk> a suburb from London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw was that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse reality.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination with astrophysics, or in the <unk> of <unk>
Otherwise these kids didn't fit in beautiful frames and <unk> as he said, and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted it.
Initially, they were lost for trying to make sense of their data.
How did anyone not realize these kids before?
But then I had found a reference to an article that was published in German in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then he <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article about competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was no one translation of the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German -- and he was doing it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children were <unk> even for contemporary <unk>
The morning in his clinic started with music classes with music, and kids follow their games on Sundays for the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as disability <unk> of life that required support of support and spaces adapted throughout the course of life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, Asperger's calls them their little teachers, and they started to help in developing methods that were especially suited to them.
<unk> Asperger's saw autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of sentences and disabilities.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they always have been, watching this continuum of this continuum in history known in Islamic culture as the awkward social and Professor <unk>
He was more there even to say that for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith discovered that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> as well as the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the <unk> criteria that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and the early 1990s, their changes in <unk> by the limited model of <unk> for a broad and Asperger's method.
These changes didn't go in a broken bag.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked with each day to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before he came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four <unk> of <unk> <unk> psychologists, masters and parents of everybody knew what autism was.
At the same time, the first few clinical trials were introduced to use to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for her son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes on the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnostics started <unk> just as they predicted <unk> and <unk> they were actually waiting for them to be able to make people with autism and their families finally held the support and the services that they <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the rise in the diagnostics. And very simple, and very powerful, <unk> story as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of preventing one of every 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right, the <unk> are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles to solve for new advances in the <unk> to celebrate the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a deficit of attention to detail.
<unk> autistic people have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which creates that the <unk> for the most interconnected aspects of autism are found in understanding of teachers, employers with skills, support communities, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we <unk> towards an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to lose a brain.
Thank you.
